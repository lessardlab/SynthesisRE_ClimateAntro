Species of Brevoortia are important components of the marine food web of coastal ecosystems in the Atlantic and contribute significantly to fisheries. In this study, the first phylogenetic and biogeographic hypotheses including all species of Brevoortia are presented. A total of 113 specimens were analyzed using three molecular markers (two mitochondrial: COI and 16s; and one nuclear: RAG2). Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference were employed to estimate phylogenetic relationships. A Bayesian multispecies coalescent approach was used to estimate a dated phylogeny, which supported biogeographic analyses of ancestral geographic ranges. Results corroborate previous hypotheses that the four North Atlantic species are grouped in two clades, one composed of B. tyrannus (Latrobe, 1802) and B. patronus Goode, 1878, and the second including B. smithi Hildebrand, 1941 and B. gunteri Hildebrand, 1948. The South Atlantic B. aurea (Spix and Agassiz, 1829) and B. pectinata (Jenyns, 1842) form a third clade, which is sister to the clade composed of B. smithi and B. gunteri. The monophyly and validity of the six nominal species of Brevoortia were not supported. Results also indicate that Brevoortia originated in the North Atlantic during the middle Miocene (about 15 Mya). A cooling event of the tropical Atlantic at around 10 Mya likely facilitated the range expansion of the genus to the South Atlantic, whereas a significant warming of the tropical Atlantic waters during the late Miocene at 6?7 Mya possibly promoted the isolation between the northern and southern counterparts of that ancestral lineage. The relevance of the Florida Peninsula in association with sea level fluctuations for the diversification within Brevoortia is also discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1055-7903,1095-9513,,,,JUL,2021,160,,,,,,,,107108,10.1016/j.ympev.2021.107108,,,,,,,WOS:000647570600010,33631353,,,,,
J,"Singer, MC; Parmesan, C",,,,"Singer, Michael C.; Parmesan, Camille",,,Colonizations cause diversification of host preferences: A mechanism explaining increased generalization at range boundaries expanding under climate change,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"As species' poleward range limits expand under climate change, generalists are expected to be better colonists than specialists, extending their ranges faster. This effect of specialization on range shifts has been shown, but so has the reverse cause-effect: in a global meta-analysis of butterfly diets, it was range expansions themselves that caused increases in population-level diet breadth. What could drive this unexpected process? We provide a novel behavioral mechanism by showing that, in a butterfly with extensive ecotypic variation, Edith's checkerspot, diet breadths increased after colonization events as diversification of individual host preferences pulled novel hosts into population diets. Subsequently, populations that persisted reverted toward monophagy. We draw together three lines of evidence from long-term studies of 15 independently evolving populations. First, direct observations showed a significant increase in specialization across decades: in recent censuses, eight populations used fewer host genera than in the 1980s while none used more. Second, behavioral preference-testing experiments showed that extinctions and recolonizations at two sites were followed, at first by diversification of heritable preference ranks and increases in diet breadth, and subsequently by homogenization of preferences and contractions of diet breadth. Third, we found a significant negative association in the 1980s between population-level diet breadth and genetic diversity. Populations with fewer mtDNA haplotypes had broader diets, extending to 3-4 host genera, while those with higher haplotype diversity were more specialized. We infer that diet breadth had increased in younger, recently colonized populations. Preference diversification after colonization events, whether caused by (cryptic) host shifts or by release of cryptic genetic variation after population bottlenecks, provides a mechanism for known effects of range shifts on diet specialization. Our results explain how colonizations at expanding range margins have increased population-level diet breadths, and predict that increasing specialization should accompany population persistence as current range edges become range interiors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/gcb.15656,,JUN 2021,,,,,WOS:000656655500001,33896082,,,,,

Long-distance dispersal events have been widely documented in male tigers (Panthera tigris), but similar events in female tigers are less known. We opportunistically recorded a long-distance dispersal event that ended with the establishment of a new home-range for a radio-collared sub-adult female tiger in central India. We analysed the animal's movement patterns during the dispersal event and the subsequent home-range establishment. The average minimum distance and the average minimum daily displacements were 11.4 km and 4.5 km respectively. The total linear and cumulative displacements were 99.1 km and 340.2 km respectively, undertaken over 78 days. Using a Brownian bridge movement model, we showed that the tiger was not moving in a linear path, but showed exploratory movement. During this dispersal event, the tiger traversed an area of 2082 km(2) (95% UD), including 19 distinct 'stepping-stone' habitat patches. Combining the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck movement behaviour model and an autocorrelated kernel density estimation model, we identified a newly established home range of 40.3 km(2) at the end of the dispersal event. Our results describe the longest known female tiger dispersal event, highlighting the possibility that natural dispersal of female tigers can provide an additional option to assisted translocations for the species range expansion. This is relevant in current scenarios where tiger habitats remain fragmented and tiger population numbers are recovering due to effective in situ conservation efforts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1612-4642,1439-0574,,,,JUN,2021,67,3,,,,,,,54,10.1007/s10344-021-01494-2,,,,,,,WOS:000649712100001,,,,,,

Given the exponential growth of alien species passing through the initial point of introduction, reporting an alien species on its initial appearance is important. Sisymbrium irio, an annual herb distributed widely throughout the northern hemisphere, is a notorious weed for its strong invasiveness. In 2016 S. irio was first reported in Korea. The plant was found along the urban expressway, Beonyeong-ro, connecting Busan trading port to Gyeongbu expressway. To properly identify the species, we collected ten S. irio samples from the reported site and examine their morphological characters. The identification key of Sisymbrium irio and its related species in the genus was constructed to clarify taxonomic confusions. We further determined the identity of the taxa by inferring the phylogeny of S. irio and the related taxa. To investigate the distribution changes for the past four years since the first observation in 2016, we monitored the area in late summer of 2020. Both morphological and molecular examinations indicated that the Sisymbrium species we found in Korea for the first time was S. irio. From our site monitoring, we newly found a second distribution site that is approximately 1.5 km away from the original site. Considering the geographical proximity of the introduction sites from the port, we hypothesize that S. irio might started expanding its range by the aid of roads.

They hold high tolerance to abiotic stress and their genetic, lifehistory, and behavioural adaptation mechanisms prompt their invasive conspicuousness. However, there is a generalized ambiguity on the specific processes that make these bioinvasions successful. No trait-related patterns have yet been found, mostly since traits attributed solely to non-indigenous crab species lack confirmation by comparison with their native counterparts and across each other. Therefore, this review discusses the available literature on fitness and plasticity of brachyuran crabs under global changes, and advances the increasing importance of addressing native versus non-native invasive species comparisons in the annals of brachyura invasion dynamics. Further on, integrative approaches are highlighted and proposed as innovative tools to disentangle trait-related tolerance, overall crab phenotypic plasticity and further adaptation. These indicator tools will advance the knowledge on crabs? invasive potential, which ultimately affects upcoming population dynamics and ecosystem services, adding value to an effective management of coastal bioinvasions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1470-160X,1872-7034,,,,JUN,2021,125,,,,,,41,51,107578,10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107578,,,,,,,WOS:000637200900004,,,,,,

Their reproductive capabilities and ability to thrive in various habitats enabled them to become extremely successful invasive aliens, now established throughout much of England (887 10 km squares, almost all contiguous, in 2016), and a few locations in Wales and Northern Ireland. The species is included within the E.U. list of Invasive Aliens of Union Concern stemming from Regulation (EU) 1143/2014.

We predict that this species could expand its range to include every European country, although the availability of suitable landcover and climate is likely to vary substantially between countries.

Methods We determined the observed naturalized distribution outside Europe for 1,485 species endemic to Europe using the Global Naturalized Alien Flora (GloNAF) database and their expected distributions outside Europe using species distribution models. First, we investigated which of seven socio-economic factors related to introduction pathways, anthropogenic pressures and inventory effort best explained the differences between observed and expected naturalized European floras. Second, we examined whether distributional features, economic use and functional traits explain the extent to which species have filled their expected ranges outside Europe. Results In terms of suitable area, more than 95% of expected naturalizations of European plants were not yet observed. Species were naturalized in only 4.2% of their suitable regions outside of Europe (range filling) and in 0.4% of their unsuitable regions (range expansion). Anthropogenic habitat disturbance primarily explained the difference between observed and expected naturalized European floras, as did the number of treaties relevant to invasive species. Species of ornamental and economic value and with large specific leaf area performed better at filling and expanding beyond their expected range.

Successful regeneration is crucial for population persistence and range expansion. Thus, we aimed to identify environmental variables that affect germination and seedling establishment of Europe's dominant forest tree, to compare the importance of plasticity and genetic variation for regeneration, and to evaluate the regeneration potential at and beyond the southern and northern distribution margins. Location Europe. Time period 2016-2018. Major taxa studied European beech (Fagus sylvatica (L.)). Methods We investigated how germination, establishment and juvenile survival change across a reciprocal transplantation experiment using over 9,000 seeds of beech from 7 populations from its southern to its northern distribution range margins. Results Germination and establishment at the seedling stage were highly plastic in response to environmental conditions. Germination success increased with warmer and declined with colder air temperature, whereas establishment and survival were hampered under warmer and drier conditions. Germination differed among populations and was positively influenced by seed weight. However, there was no evidence of local adaptation in any trait. Main conclusions The high plasticity in the early life-history traits found irrespective of seed origin may allow for short-term acclimatization. However, our results also indicate that this plasticity might not be sufficient to ensure the regeneration of beech in the future due to the low survival found under dry and hot conditions.

Following genetic analyses that suggested the pumpkinseed all originated from the same founding population, life history trait analyses revealed pronounced differences between the sites at the core and front that were independent of environmental factors. Pumpkinseed in sites towards the invasion front were of relatively low abundance and displayed relatively high reproductive investment, with heavier gonads, higher fecundity and smaller eggs. They also had faster growth rates than pumpkinseed in sites towards the core of the invasion. The traits displayed by pumpkinseed at sites in the mid-range were intermediate between the extremes displayed by fish at core and frontal sites.

Projections for contrasting scenarios of future climate change were also developed to anticipate genetic diversity losses at regional scales. Results showed that S. thunbergii harbours strikingly rich genetic diversity and multiple divergent lineages in the centre-northern range of its distribution, in contrast with a poorer genetically distinct lineage in the southern range. SDM hindcasted refugial persistence in the southern range during the LGM as well as post-LGM expansion of 18 degrees of latitude northward. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) analysis further suggested that the multiple divergent lineages in the centre-northern range limit stem from post-LGM colonization from the southern survived lineage. This suggests divergence due to demographic bottlenecks during range expansion and massive genetic diversity loss during post-LGM contraction in the south.

The main aim was to test two alternative hypotheses about the main drivers of diversification of biotas from deserts in the region: Andean uplift versus Pleistocene fragmentation/dispersal. Location South America, Central Andes, Atacama Desert. Taxon Psectrascelis (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). Methods A phylogenetic tree based on cytochrome oxidase I, 16S and Wg genes was prepared for multiple individuals from 36 populations of the region representing 14 species or subspecies. Divergence times, ancestral ranges and biogeographic events that may have led to the current distribution and species diversity were estimated. Results The first split within the genus is not directly related to the Andean uplift but began at the time of global cooling at similar to 3.5 Ma, when the Andes had already reached their current altitude. Further differentiations of Psectrascelis lineages were mostly caused by common and more global drivers resulting in major clusters of diversifications at similar to 2.6-2.2 Ma, similar to 1.3-0.7 Ma and several subsequent events during the mid- to late Quaternary. Today, the two main clades of Psectrascelis almost meet each other after presumably synchronous range expansions along the Western Cordillera. Main conclusions Diversification of Psectrascelis has primarily been affected by global climate changes since the mid-Pliocene and has involved multiple vicariance and jump dispersal events. We hypothesize that jump dispersal events have occasionally been accompanied by adaptation to stronger aridity, which paved the way for range expansion into previously unsuitable habitats and eventually led to synchronous colonizations without spatial overlap along different isohyets in the Western Cordillera during the late Pleistocene.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/jbi.14123,,MAY 2021,,,,,WOS:000647929000001,,,,,,

We evaluated field-measured traits, conducted glasshouse experiments simulating different nitrogen and water availability treatments, and did reciprocal transplants to compare functional traits and plasticity between the founders of both species (i.e. 'invasive-non-invasive congeners' comparison), and between P. juliflora individuals from plantations and invaded sites (i.e. testing for rapid evolution during invasion). We found that planted individuals of P. julifora and P. pallida differed in a number of key traits related to performance and spread (root:shoot ratio, number of stems and susceptibility to seed damage) as well as in levels of phenotypic plasticity in growth responses to resource availability, which may explain their differential invasiveness. Offspring of invasive P. juliflora individuals had higher seed mass and production, germination, survival, produced more stems, matured earlier and had higher plasticity compared with those of founder individuals, indicative of rapid post-introduction evolution.

Based on eight nuclear microsatellite genotypes of a total of 150 individuals and 225 seeds at the northernmost leading-edge population, genetic diversity, fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS), and genetic differentiation from other five northern populations were investigated. Moreover, both seed and pollen immigration and their effects on genetic diversity at different successional stages were analyzed. The leading-edge population showed lower genetic diversity and substantial genetic differentiation, reflecting its strong genetic drift. Non-significant FSGS and a negative inbreeding coefficient for mature trees may indicate that the earliest generation consisted of founders from foreign seed sources. The significant proportion of seed and pollen immigration increased the number of different alleles for later successional stages. The effective number of pollen parents from foreign sources (20.8) was markedly higher than that from the local source (2.1). These results indicated that pollen immigration incorporated new and rare alleles and increased the genetic diversity of the population.

Using the opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis with plasmid-encoded beta-lactamase, we track colony expansion dynamics and visualize spatial patterns in fluorescently labeled populations exposed to antibiotics. We find that the radial expansion rate of mixed communities is approximately constant over a wide range of drug concentrations and initial population compositions. Imaging of the final populations shows that resistance to ampicillin is cooperative, with sensitive cells surviving in the presence of resistant cells at otherwise lethal concentrations. The populations exhibit a diverse range of spatial segregation patterns that depend on drug concentration and initial conditions. Mathematical models indicate that the observed dynamics are consistent with global cooperation, despite the fact that beta-lactamase remains cell-associated. Experiments confirm that resistant colonies provide a protective effect to sensitive cells on length scales multiple times the size of a single colony, and populations seeded with (on average) no more than a single resistant cell can produce mixed communities in the presence of the drug. While biophysical models of drug degradation suggest that individual resistant cells offer only short-range protection to neighboring cells, we show that long-range protection may arise from synergistic effects of multiple resistant cells, providing surprisingly large protection zones even at small population fractions.",,,,,"Wood, Kevin/0000-0002-0985-7401",,,,,,,,,,,,1751-7362,1751-7370,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1038/s41396-021-00982-2,,MAY 2021,,,,,WOS:000647533200005,33953363,,,,,

However, there is a need for information regarding the restoration-relevant performance of foundation species like mangrove and marsh plants, including their responses to acute and chronic stressors that can affect restoration outcomes. Mangrove encroachment and poleward range expansion into marsh, facilitated by warming winters, has provided restoration practitioners in the northern Gulf of Mexico with a new foundation plant species to consider using during restoration. To evaluate the performance of transplanted mangroves and characterize restoration-relevant marsh-mangrove interactions, we planted nursery-raised black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) seedlings within different marsh cover treatments along an eroding marsh-dominated shoreline in Louisiana. Mangrove seedling survival increased with greater densities of marsh cover, indicating that marsh grass (Spartina alterniflora) may facilitate mangrove establishment. However, only 35% of transplanted mangrove seedlings established after 10 weeks, suggesting a low return on resources expended in raising seedlings for 1-3 years in greenhouse conditions. Moreover, a 2018 freeze event killed 100% of transplanted mangrove seedlings, while nearby naturally established mangroves suffered minor damage. Our results, along with those in the mangrove restoration literature, indicate that planting mangroves in the northern Gulf of Mexico may not be the most efficient use of limited resources.

Once a novel species spreads across a boundary, it can have a substantial impact on the ecosystem, for instance by competing with local species, and, over the long-term, re-engineer the ecosystem. Marine biogeographic regions are clearly defined on the coast of southern Africa and we tested the influence of their boundaries on the spread and spatial structure of an alien ecosystem engineer.

Methods Records of M. galloprovincialis were compiled into a database to determine its decadal patterns of spread across multiple bioregions. Distribution and abundance (estimated using density and semi-quantitative abundance scale [ACFOR]) of this mussel were surveyed to determine patterns in spatial structure across bioregions. In addition, we compared the size structure of populations at the eastern margins of its range with those of larger populations nearer the range centre. Results Initial breaching of biogeographic boundaries was associated with rapid spread, but other boundaries encountered decades later acted as barriers to further spread. Across >2,800 km of coast, spatial autocorrelation was observed in densities (low and mid shore levels) and in ACFOR abundances. Repeating spatial patterns in densities and ACFOR abundance were detected at scales of 120-160 km and of 400-990 km. Considerable effort was required to detect populations at the absolute eastern limits of its distribution. Main conclusion Detection of spatial structures at multiple scales suggests that ecologically determined processes regulate abundance at both intra-bioregional and inter-bioregional scales, which may help tease apart the historic and contemporary consequences of interspecific interactions on the structure of rocky shore communities.

Negative effects of a genetic bottleneck are typically considered to be relaxed in benign environments because of a release from stress. Despite its relevance to understand and predict invasions, empirical evidence on the role of genetic diversity in relation to habitat quality is largely lacking. We use the mite Tetranychus urticae Koch as a model to experimentally assess spread rate and size of genetically depleted inbred populations vs. enriched mixed populations. This was assessed in replicated linear patch systems consisting of benign (bean), challenging (tomato), or a gradient (bean to tomato) habitat.

However, we found that population spread rates were increased due to genetic diversity in the benign but not in the challenging habitat.

Here, we contrast populations of the European subspecies Arabidopsis lyrata ssp. petraea, which expanded its Northern range after the last glaciation. We document a sharp decline in effective population size in the range-edge population and observe that nonsynonymous variants segregate at higher frequencies. We detect a 4.9% excess of derived nonsynonymous variants per individual in the range-edge population, suggesting an increase of the genomic burden of deleterious mutations. Inference of the fitness effects of mutations and modeling of allele frequencies under the explicit demographic history of each population predicts a depletion of rare deleterious variants in the range-edge population, but an enrichment for fixed ones, consistent with the bottleneck effect. However, the demographic history of the range-edge population predicts a small net decrease in per-individual fitness. Consistent with this prediction, the range-edge population is not impaired in its growth and survival measured in a common garden experiment.

Recent studies have highlighted the continued loss of megafauna in terrestrial ecosystems and the subsequent surge of small mammals, such as rodents, bats, lagomorphs, and insectivores. However, the ecological partitioning of these animals will likely lead to large variation in their responses to environmental change. In the present study, we investigated the evolutionary history and genetic adaptations of white-bellied rats (Niviventer Marshall, 1976), which are widespread in the natural terrestrial ecosystems in Asia but also known as important zoonotic pathogen vectors and transmitters. The southeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was inferred as the origin center of this genus, with parallel diversification in temperate and tropical niches. Demographic history analyses from mitochondrial and nuclear sequences of Niviventer demonstrated population size increases and range expansion for species in Southeast Asia, and habitat generalists elsewhere. Unexpectedly, population increases were seen in N. eha, which inhabits the highest elevation among Niviventer species. Genome scans of nuclear exons revealed that among the congeneric species, N. eha has the largest number of positively selected genes.

We used weighted cost-distances to identify linkages between core areas and circuit theory to model overall connectivity potential. We calculated selection ratios for land covers (30 m res) at fine and coarse scales. The ensemble distribution model had good performance (ROC of 0.94). Suitability was positively associated with increasing vegetation structure, lower distance to natural cover, and mid-high terrain ruggedness. Forest covers were always selected for regardless of scale, and human development was avoided only at the coarser scale.

For populations with freely recombining loci underlying the trait under selection (hereafter, adaptive loci), the critical gradient in one-dimensional habitats depends on the fitness cost of dispersal and the strength of selection relative to genetic drift. Here, we extend the previous work in two directions and ask, What is the role of the recombination rate between the adaptive loci during range expansions? And what effect does the ability of selfing as opposed to obligate outcrossing have on range expansions? To answer these questions, we use computer simulations. We demonstrate that while reduced recombination rates between adaptive loci slow down range expansions as a result of poor purging of locally deleterious alleles at the expansion front, they may also allow a species to occupy a greater range. In addition, we find that the allowance of selfing may improve the ability of populations to expand their ranges, for example, because selfing among potentially rare high-fitness individuals facilitates the establishment and maintenance of locally well-adapted genotypes. We conclude that during range expansions there is a trade-off between positive and negative effects of recombination within and between individuals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0147,1537-5323,,,,MAY 1,2021,197,5,,,,,526,542,,10.1086/713669,,MAY 2021,,,,,WOS:000637866600001,33908832,,,,,

Here, we investigate sex differences in morphology, behaviour and genomic population differentiation along a climate-mediated range expansion in the common bluetail damselfly (Ischnura elegans) in northern Europe. We sampled 65 sites along a 583-km gradient spanning the I. elegans range in Sweden and quantified latitudinal gradients in site relative abundance, sex ratio and sex-specific shifts in body size and mating status (a measure of sexual selection). Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for 426 individuals from 25 sites, we further investigated sex-specific landscape and climatic effects on neutral genetic connectivity and migration patterns. We found evidence for sex differences associated with the I. elegans range expansion, namely (a) increased male body size with latitude, but no latitudinal effect on female body size, resulting in reduced sexual dimorphism towards the range limit, (b) a steeper decline in male genetic similarity with increasing geographic distance than in females, (c) male-biased genetic migration propensity and (d) a latitudinal cline in migration distance (increasing migratory distances towards the range margin), which was stronger in males. Cooler mean annual temperatures towards the range limit were associated with increased resistance to gene flow in both sexes. Sex ratios became increasingly male biased towards the range limit, and there was evidence for a changed sexual selection regime shifting from favouring larger males in the south to favouring smaller males in the north. Our findings suggest sex-specific spatial phenotype sorting at the range limit, where larger males disperse more under higher landscape resistance associated with cooler climates. The combination of latitudinal gradients in sex-biased dispersal, increasing male body size and (reduced) sexual size dimorphism should have emergent consequences for sexual selection dynamics and the mating system at the expanding range front.

Dendroctonus ponderosae uses chemical cues including host and non-host VOCs, as well as aggregation pheromones to navigate through the environment and find a suitable reproductive host. The dispersal flight distance of D. ponderosae from its natal host to its reproductive host varies widely, even within populations of beetles. Beetle energetics do not entirely explain this flight variation. In this study, we test the effect of beetle exposure to semiochemical cues before and during flight on subsequent flight propensity (the likelihood of flight initiation) and flight capacity (the distance and velocity of flight) using computer-linked flight mills. Exposure to host volatiles before flight interacts with beetle pre-flight weight to influence subsequent flight capacity of female but not male beetles. Female beetles flew further and faster following exposure to their aggregation pheromone, trans-verbenol. Flight of female beetles was reduced when they were exposed to volatiles from the non-host, Populus tremuloides, during flight. This study is the first to indicate that semiochemical cues not only influence beetle orientation during flight but also flight capacity of D. ponderosae.

The raccoon Procyon lotor and the raccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides are included on the European Union's list of invasive alien species. We characterised the current climatic niches of the two species in their native ranges in North America and Asia, and compared them with their non-native-range niches in Europe, where we also projected climatic suitability. The aim was to locate suitable habitats beyond their current ranges and assess where a range expansion can be expected. Niche comparison and the projection of climatic suitability in Europe were based on eight bioclimatic variables and presence records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility database. For niche modelling, we applied the maximum entropy approach (Maxent) and used the native-range data for training. Minimum temperature of the coldest month (bio06) was identified as the most important bioclimatic variable in the habitat suitability models for both species. Different tolerance levels regarding this variable might explain small differences between the species' projected ranges, especially in the north and east of Europe. The high niche unfilling for both species in Europe suggests a potential for expansion beyond their present ranges.

We reconstructed the thermal performance curves of life history (survival, growth and development rates), behaviour (food intake) and cold tolerance (chill coma recovery time) in the aquatic larval stage of the damselfly Ischnura elegans that is currently showing a poleward range expansion in northern Europe. We studied larvae from three edge and three core populations using a common-garden experiment. Consistent with the colder annual temperatures, larvae at the expansion front evolved an improved cold tolerance. The edge populations showed no overall (across temperatures) evolution of a faster life history that would improve their range-shifting ability. Moreover, consistent with damselfly edge populations from colder latitudes, edge populations evolved at the highest rearing temperature (28 degrees C) a faster development rate, likely to better exploit the rare periods with higher temperatures. This was associated with a higher food intake and a lower metabolic rate. In conclusion, our results suggest that the edge populations rapidly evolved adaptive changes in trait means and thermal plasticity to the novel thermal conditions at the edge front.

In Greenland, the warming also drives accelerating melt of the Greenland Ice Sheet resulting in more meltwater entering Greenland fjords in summer. Our aim was to determine if increasing summer temperatures combined with lower salinity can induce the expression of stress-related proteins, for example, heat shock protein, in boreal intertidal mussels in Greenland, and whether low salinity reduces the upper thermal limit at which mortality occurs. We conducted a mortality experiment, using 12 different combinations of salinity and air temperature treatments during a simulated tidal regime, and quantified the change in mRNA levels of five stress-related genes (hsp24, hsp70, hsp90, sod and p38) in surviving mussels to discern the level of sublethal stress. Heat-induced mortality occurred in mussels exposed to an air temperature of 30 degrees C and mortality was higher in treatments with lowered salinity (5 and 15 parts per thousand), which confirms that low habitat salinity decreases the upper thermal limit of Mytilus edulis. The gene expression analysis supported the mortality results, with the highest gene expression found at combinations of high temperature and low salinity. Combined with seasonal measurements of intertidal temperatures in Greenland, we suggest heat stress occurs in low salinity intertidal area, and that further lowered salinity in coastal water due to increased run-off can make intertidal bivalves more susceptible to summer heat stress.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that, due to its intermediate geographical location, NW Africa is pivotal in explaining the phylogeographical patterns of taxa with Mediterranean-Macaronesian distributions using a legume species with short generation times. Location: Mediterranean, with a focus on NW Africa and the Canary Islands. Taxon: Pitch trefoil (Bituminaria bituminosa). Methods: We generated genetic data and performed phylogeographical and demographic analyses at two geographical scales: Mediterranean Basin (MB), using plastid sequences (115 individuals), and Macaronesia, using plastid sequences (182 individuals) and 10 nuclear microsatellite loci (220 individuals). We also performed a literature survey focusing on phylogeographical studies of other circum-Mediterranean taxa. Results: Northwest Africa was identified as a centre of genetic diversity (19 out of 38 haplotypes) and demographic expansion of B. bituminosa in the MB during the Pleistocene. Our literature review revealed two main phylogeographical patterns in widespread species: pre-Mediterranean evergreen sclerophylls versus Pleistocene facultative-deciduous (including Bituminaria) taxa, but on average, both functional groups show a similar, large genetic diversity (similar to 40% of haplotypes) in NW Africa. At the Macaronesian scale, we found that Canarian Bituminaria is composed of two genetic sublineages that coexist and hybridize on the central islands and in the mainland Macaronesian enclave (Anti-Atlas region). Demographic analyses rejected the progression rule as the model of island colonization but strongly suggested that Anti-Atlas populations are the result of back-colonization from the easternmost islands before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Conclusions: Bituminaria displays a pattern of Quaternary eastward expansion in the MB that appears to be paralleled by several members of its functional plant group.

Genomic approaches provide insight into where, when, and how adaptation operates during and after speciation and can measure historical and modern introgression. Whether adaptive or neutral in origin, hybridization can cause mitonuclear discordance by placing the mitochondrial genome of one species (or population) in the nuclear background of another species. The latter, introgressed species may eventually have its own mtDNA replaced or captured by other species across its entire geographical range. Intermediate stages in the capture process should be observable. Two nonsister species of Australasian monarch-flycatchers, Spectacled Monarch (Symposiachrus trivirgatus) mostly of Australia and Indonesia and Spot-winged Monarch (S. guttula) of New Guinea, present an opportunity to observe this process. We analysed thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived from ultraconserved elements of all subspecies of both species. Mitochondrial DNA sequences of Australian populations of S. trivirgatus form two paraphyletic clades, one being sister to and presumably introgressed by S. guttula despite little nuclear signal of introgression.

We also uncovered introgression from the Maluku Islands subspecies of S. trivirgatus into an island population of S. guttula, resulting in apparent nuclear paraphyly. We find that neutral demographic processes, not adaptive introgression, are the most likely cause of these complex population histories. We suggest that a Pleistocene extinction of S. guttula from mainland Australia resulted from range expansion by S. trivirgatus.",,,,,"Gyllenhaal, Ethan/0000-0002-0835-8520; Andersen, Michael/0000-0002-7220-5588; Mapel, Xena/0000-0002-7501-578X; McCullough, Jenna/0000-0002-7664-3868",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-1083,1365-294X,,,,MAY,2021,30,9,,,,,2087,2103,,10.1111/mec.15856,,MAR 2021,,,,,WOS:000635245300001,33615597,,,,,

For species that expand their distribution in response to warming, survival depends not only on their physiological capacity, but also on the ability to coexist or be competitive within the established community. In temperate marine reefs from around the world, the range expansion of tropical species, known as 'tropicalization', has been linked to the disappearance of temperate habitat-forming kelps and shifts to dominance by low-biomass turfing algae. The consequences of these range expansions and habitat changes on resident fish communities are, however, unclear. Here, we use data derived from baited remote underwater video (BRUV) surveys to analyse changes in diversity and abundance of marine fishes over a 17-year period in warming reefs that have experienced kelp loss (occurring c. 2009). Despite the loss of kelp, we found that species richness and overall abundance of fishes (measured as probability of occurrence and relative abundance), including both tropical and temperate species, increased through time. We also found dramatic shifts in the trophic composition of fish assemblages. Tropical herbivorous fish increased most markedly through time, and temperate-associated planktivores were the only group that declined, a potential consequence of tropicalization not previously identified. At the species level, we identified 22 tropical and temperate species from four trophic guilds that significantly increased in occurrence, while only three species (all temperate associated) declined. Morphological trait space models suggest increases in fish diversity and overall occurrence are unlikely to be driven by uniqueness of traits among tropical range expanders. Our results show more winners than losers and suggest that pathways of energy flow will change in tropicalized systems, as planktonic inputs become less important and a higher proportion of algal productivity gets consumed locally by increasingly abundant herbivores.",,,,"Verges, Adriana/B-8288-2013","Verges, Adriana/0000-0002-3507-1234; Malcolm, Hamish/0000-0001-7315-1537",,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,JUN,2021,27,11,,,,,2537,2548,,10.1111/gcb.15592,,MAR 2021,,,,,WOS:000634969000001,33694271,,,,,

Nevertheless, translocations are common practices in agri- and aquaculture. Each year, millions of wild-caught wrasses are transported large distances to be used as cleaner fish for parasite control in marine salmon farms. Recently, it was documented that translocated cleaner fish are able to escape and reproduce with local wild populations. This is especially a challenge in Norway, which is the world's largest salmon producer. Here, a panel of 84 informative SNPs was developed to identify the presence of nonlocal corkwing wrasse (Symphodus melops) escapees and admixed individuals in wild populations in western Norway. Applying this panel to similar to 2000 individuals, escapees and hybrids were found to constitute up to 20% of the local population at the northern edge of the species' distribution. The introduction of southern genetic material at the northern edge of the species distribution range has altered the local genetic composition and could obstruct local adaptation and further range expansion. Surprisingly, in other parts of the species distribution where salmon farming is also common, few escapees and hybrids were found. Why hybridization seems to be common only in the far north is discussed in the context of demographic and transport history. However, the current lack of reporting of escapes makes it difficult to evaluate possible causes for why some aquaculture-dense areas have more escapees and hybrids than others. The results obtained in this study, and the observed high genomic divergence between the main export and import regions, puts the sustainability of mass translocation of nonlocal wild wrasse into question and suggests that the current management regime needs re-evaluation.",,,,"Knutsen, Halvor/A-4261-2009","Knutsen, Halvor/0000-0002-7627-7634; Jansson, Eeva/0000-0002-7840-7201; Faust, Ellika/0000-0001-9823-9703",,,,,,,,,,,,1752-4571,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/eva.13220,,MAR 2021,,,,,WOS:000634363600001,,,,,,

However, situations where models could be the most valuable ecologically or economically, such as for predicting invasion risk, often pose the greatest challenges to SDM building. These challenges include non-equilibrium range expansion, low or uneven prevalence, and interest in projecting distributions into environments that are non-analogous to the environments used for model building. Location Minnesota, USA. Taxon Cardamine impatiens (Narrowleaf Bittercress), Celastrus orbiculatus (Oriental Bittersweet), and Humulus japonicus (Japanese Hops). Methods We took a novel approach to build robust species distribution models of invasive species using occurrence-environment correlations between invasive species and co-occurring native community members. The correlations were obtained from a joint species distribution model (JSDM) of a densely sampled database of 10,336 MN plant communities from across the state of Minnesota, USA. Positively and negatively associated native species were incorporated into the model as surrogate presences and pseudoabsences (weighted by their environmental correlations) along with invasive species occurrences records (surrogate SDMs). Results Surrogate models performed better than traditional SDMs in predicting occurrences along the northern invasion margin (outside the training area). Both types of models had similarly high cross-validation metrics in the area of training. Surrogate models also predicted greater range expansion beyond the current geographic range. Main conclusions These results demonstrate that modelers can take advantage of detailed community data to develop SDMs that leverage surrogate native species as phytometers of environments beyond the current area of occupancy.

Taking the rapidly expanded bird, Asian openbill (Anastomus oscitans), as a model species, we investigated niche dynamics and its potential effects on the population by Niche A and ecospat, predicted potential distribution by biomod2. Results showed that niche expansion has occurred in two non-native populations caused by the tolerance of colder and wetter environments, and potential distribution mainly concentrated on equatorial islands. Our study suggested that the expanded niche belongs to tolerance niche concept according to the populations' dynamics and GPS tracking evidence.

Understanding the patterns and drivers of changes in the distribution and abundance of species in our rapidly changing environment is therefore urgent. Cases of species showing trends that run counter to general population declines, especially when they deliver key ecosystem services, are especially interesting. The tree bumblebee (Bombus hypnorum), which belongs to a globally important group of pollinators, has substantially expanded its range in recent years in direct contrast to many other species within this group. Here we reconstructed the likely pattern of colonization of the UK based on RAD-seq population genomic data combined with Bayesian population modelling. This RAD-seq approach also enabled an analysis of genomic regions potentially under selection. We report a complex and dynamic colonization pattern that is most likely ongoing.

The invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is spreading in Eurasia and the Americas, into both fresh and brackish water. We aim to understand if reproduction in different salinities is affected by an ability to acclimate. Location Brackish and freshwater systems of northern Europe and the Baltic Sea. Methods We cross-exposed round gobies of freshwater and brackish origin to 0 and 16 practical salinity units (PSU), and the fish were given nest boxes in which to spawn. After 4 weeks, we measured their sperm performance in both 0 and 16 PSU; fertilization success of each egg clutch was measured through visual analysis of eggs. Clutches were split and allowed to develop in both 0 and 16 PSU salinity, and reproductive success (zygote development) was measured 20 +/- 1 days later. Responses were analysed using generalized mixed models. Results After a month, the fish showed no plasticity in sperm performance to their acclimation salinity, regardless of their origin. Sperm velocity was highest in the salinity similar to the males' origin. Significantly lower fertilization success was measured for individuals that reproduced outside their salinity of origin despite recurring spawning events in all treatment groups. Among fertilized eggs, zygote development was similar regardless of salinity treatment of either eggs or parents. Main Conclusions Short-term acclimation to new salinities does not affect sperm performance in the round goby. Alternative hypotheses such as local adaption should be further investigated.

However, little is known concerning the consequences of distributional changes on community-level interactions, and responses by generalist species might have many ecological implications in terms of novel interactions with resident species. In this study, we applied Ecological Niche Models and niche analysis to three generalist bat species, Hypsugo savii, Pipistrellus kuhlii, and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, which share similar ecological traits and are sympatric in parts of their ranges. Our aims were to investigate how predicted climate change will affect species' distribution and to analyse the degree of climatic niche overlap between the three species, in both the current and the future scenarios (2050 and 2070; Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5). Temperatures were the most important predictors influencing species' range expansion in future. According to our models, Pipistrellus kuhlii and Hypsugo savii may expand their geographic ranges towards northern latitudes, whereas the geographic range of the less thermophilous Pipistrellus will shift northwards, resulting in it losing the southern portion in Europe. The already considerable degree of climatic niche overlap between the three species will increase further in future. On the basis of our findings, within the new areas potentially colonised by all three species in future, alterations in community-level balance might occur, bringing about effects that are only partially predictable.

In North America, decreases in the frequency and intensity of extreme winter cold events are expected to allow the poleward range expansion of many cold-sensitive tropical organisms, sometimes at the expense of temperate organisms. Although ecologists have long noted the critical ecological role of winter cold temperature extremes in tropical-temperate transition zones, the ecological effects of extreme cold events have been understudied, and the influence of warming winter temperatures has too often been left out of climate change vulnerability assessments. Here, we examine the influence of extreme cold events on the northward range limits of a diverse group of tropical organisms, including terrestrial plants, coastal wetland plants, coastal fishes, sea turtles, terrestrial reptiles, amphibians, manatees, and insects. For these organisms, extreme cold events can lead to major physiological damage or landscape-scale mass mortality. Conversely, the absence of extreme cold events can foster population growth, range expansion, and ecological regime shifts. We discuss the effects of warming winters on species and ecosystems in tropical-temperate transition zones.

We studied interactions between nettle-feeding butterflies and their shared natural enemies (parasitoids) locally and across 500 km latitudinal gradient in Sweden. We also examined the potential impact of the range-expansion of the butterfly Araschnia levana on resident butterflies via shared parasitoids, by studying how parasitism in resident butterflies covaries with the presence or absence of the newly-established species. We collected 6777 larvae of four nettle-feeding butterfly species (Aglais urticae, Aglais io, Ar. levana and Vanessa atalanta), over two years, at 19 sites distributed along the gradient. We documented the parasitoid complex for each butterfly species and measured their overlap, and analysed how parasitism rates were affected by butterfly species assemblage, variations in abundance, time, and the arrival of Ar. levana. Parasitoids caused high mortality, with substantial overlap in the complex of parasitoids associated with the four host butterflies. Levels of parasitism differed significantly among butterflies and were influenced by the local butterfly species assemblage. Our results also suggest that parasitism in resident butterflies is elevated at sites where Ar. levana has been established for a longer period. In our study system, variations in butterfly species assemblages were associated in a predictable way with substantial variations in rates of parasitism. This relationship is likely to affect the dynamics of the butterfly host species, and potentially cascade to the larger number of species with which they interact.

Here, we examine the origin and structure of a transition zone between two subspecies of Tephroseris helenitis along the central Northern Alps, using molecular (AFLP) and morphological (achene type) data in combination with ecological niche models (ENMs) to hindcast ranges at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and mid-Holocene. Samples were collected over a c. 350 km long transect, largely covered by ice during the LGM. Genetically nonadmixed individuals of subspp. helenitis versus salisburgensis dominated the westernmost versus eastern transect areas, with admixed individuals occurring in between. Clines for achene morphology and outlier loci potentially under climate-driven selection were steep, largely noncoincidental, and displaced to the east of the cline centre for neutral AFLPs. During the LGM, ssp. helenitis should have been able to persist in a refugium southwest of the transect, while suitable habitat for ssp. salisburgensis was apparently absent at this time. Together with patterns of genetic and clinal variation, our ENM data are suggestive of a primary hybrid zone that originated after the species' postglacial, eastward expansion. The observed clinal changes may thus reflect random/nonadaptive processes during expansion and selection on particular loci, and possibly achene type, in response to a long-term, west-to-east climate gradient in the direction of more stressful (e.g., wetter/cooler) conditions.

We used MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy Algorithm) to predict the distribution of a highly invasive species, namely Parthenium hysterophorus L. under four Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5) in 2050 and 2070 at global (world), regional (India) and local (Jammu & Kashmir State) spatial scales. Model predictions indicated differences in the extent of expansion in the distribution of this species under different climate change scenarios with marginal increase in moderately suitable area at the global scale but mostly a declining trend was noticed in its suitable and highly suitable area in future. More or less similar trend was predicted for India where increase in moderately suitable area was evident but decline in suitable and highly suitable areas was observed. In respect of Jammu & Kashmir, moderately suitable as well suitable area showed increase mostly under RCP scenarios of 6.0 and 8.5 in 2050 as well as 2070. Further analysis revealed that current centroid of P. hysterophorus is in south of Jammu and Kashmir and is predicted to shift by an average of 20.48 km in the north-west direction by 2050 and by 36.83 km by 2070. The future suitable area is likely to be around Hirapora Wildlife sanctuary in Kashmir. Pairwise comparison of the niche overlap and dynamics of P. hysterophorus between the native Americas and each of the regions (Africa, Asia, Australia and Oceania) where the species is introduced using Schoener's D revealed variations in the niche overlap which was high between native Americas and Australia (0.70) and Africa (0.69), moderate between Americas and Asia (0.59) and low between Americas and Oceania (0.24). Exclusion of 25% of rare climatic conditions did not have any effect on the niche overlap index (D). Niche similarity test was not significant for any of the pairwise comparisons of native Americas and the continents in which the species is non-native indicating that the native niche is more similar to the exotic niche than any randomly sampled niche from the exotic range. But the niche equivalency tests showed that the environmental realized niche of P. hysterophorus in its invaded range was not totally equivalent to that in the native range indicating niche differentiation. The niche dynamic indices based on analogous and the entire climatic space in the native and introduced regions revealed a very high niche stability. A very limited niche expansion was noticed only in Asia and niche unfilling was evident in Oceania. Like niche overlap index (D), niche expansion and niche stability were not affected by the exclusion of 25% of rare climatic conditions but marginal change was noticed in niche unfilling in the Oceania.

Therefore, models of fish biogeography may also explain the historical biogeography of freshwater mussels. We tested this assumption using predictions of three biogeographic models constructed for northern Gulf of Mexico drainages on a freshwater mussel species complex. Specifically, we tested (1) if speciation was due to vicariant events of fluctuating sea levels that separated lineages east-west of the Mobile Basin (Central Gulf Coast speciation hypothesis), (2) if the timing of divergences occurred 8.5-3.5 MYA (Gulf Coast allopatric speciation model) and (3) if diversification in Mississippi River populations was recent and for evidence of population increase consistent with range expansion into northern deglaciated regions (Pleistocene glaciation model). Location: Eastern North America. Taxon: Freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionidae), Lampsilis teres and L. floridensis. Methods: We collected 249 specimens from 73 localities across the group's distribution. We used three molecular markers (COI, NDI & ITSI) to conduct time calibrated Bayesian phylogenetic analyses, phylogeographic analyses (AMOVA & SAMOVA) and demographic analyses including Bayesian skyline plots. Results: Lampsilis teres and L. floridensis are allopatric species whose distributions meet at the eastern edge of the Mobile Basin. Speciation was estimated to occur in the late Miocene. Populations from isolated river systems surrounding the Gulf of Mexico are almost all monophyletic. Mississippi drainage samples formed a shallow clade with recent diversification and showed evidence of recent population expansion. Main conclusions: The historical biogeography of the L. teres species complex is broadly consistent with tested ichthyofaunal models.

Larvae of the pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa Schiff; PPM) are covered with setae (hair-like structures) that cause allergic reactions in warm-blooded vertebrates upon contact with the skin, eyes, or respiratory tract. Objectives Our objective was to determine whether PPM larva development, phenology, and survival change with urban warming in ways that affect the risks of this organism to people. Methods In Orleans, France, we conducted a field study of PPM larvae across a gradient of urbanization from forests to city center to measure winter survival and the timing and duration of the life stage that poses the greatest risk to people. Results Larvae in the city spent more time in the fifth, most dangerous, instar than larvae in the forest. Urban warming indirectly increased larva survival by advancing phenology of urban larvae to a more cold-tolerant life stage prior to the winter cold period. Our results indicate that local urban warming drives changes in larva biology that increase the risks the organisms pose to people.

The role of climate change remains poorly studied and is likely to influence environmental suitability, ranges, reproduction, and phenology. This study aimed to characterize the bioclimatic-habitat niche space of the Natterjack toad (Epidalea calamita) throughout its European range and to assess the impact of climate on the toad's environmental suitability and breeding behavior in Ireland, where declines in recent decades have resulted in it being regionally Red-Listed as Endangered. To address these questions, we first identified which climate variables best predict the current bioclimatic niche, fecundity (number of eggs deposit), and phenology. We then used future climate projections for two time periods (2041-2060 and 2061-2080) and two greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) to predict how the species range, fecundity, and phenology would change. The European range of the species was found to be limited by winter temperatures while its bioclimatic niche varied markedly throughout its range. Species distribution models suggested projected climate change will increase environmental suitability for the species throughout its range, including Ireland, but most notably in Scandinavia and the Baltic. Fecundity in Ireland was greatest during the cool temperatures of spring and after wet winters associated with ephemeral breeding pool availability. Warm, dry summers in the preceding year influenced fecundity the following spring indicative of carryover effects. Initiation of spawning was driven by spring temperatures, not rainfall. Projections suggested future climate change may increase fecundity in Ireland while spawning may commence earlier throughout the 21st century especially under a high greenhouse gas emission scenario (RCP 8.5). Despite recent range contraction and population declines due to habitat deterioration, the Natterjack toad, if subject to a suitable species conservation strategy, has the potential to be a climate change winner, notwithstanding unpredictable habitat and land-use change, sea-level rise inducing coastal erosion, changes in invertebrate prey abundance, and disease.",,,,"Reid, Neil/D-1896-2010","Reid, Neil/0000-0001-8951-8292; Reyne, Marina/0000-0001-7963-0774",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,MAY,2021,11,10,,,,,5049,5064,,10.1002/ece3.7362,,MAR 2021,,,,,WOS:000627561500001,34025991,,,,,

However, currently we lack a thorough understanding of the mechanisms that, on one hand, support the persistence of tropical herbivores and on the other support the recovery of temperate foundation species in tropicalized ecosystems, a required knowledge to predict potential regime shifts and reversals to the baseline state of the ecosystem. This study tested processes behind the persistence of the tropicalization of temperate reefs which experienced a complete loss of their kelp forests and an influx of tropical herbivores following a marine heatwave in 2011. For this, we assessed the feedback mechanisms that maintain turf-dominated states (recruitment of tropical herbivores, browsing and grazing rates and turf cover) and those that resist it (kelp recruitment, survival and reproductiveness). We found that the reefs remained tropicalized with high abundances of turf and tropical herbivores after 9 years from the regime shift. The rabbitfish Siganus fuscescens and the chub Kyphosus bigibbus were the most important herbivores whose persistence was supported by the adjacent reef lagoon, where seagrass meadows and the backreef habitats hosted juveniles of both species, particularly rabbitfish. Tropical herbivores exerted a strong top-down control on turf seaweed and kelp during herbivory assays, rapidly consuming kelp individuals in open areas. However, in topographical refuges in the reefs, herbivory was low and kelp individuals survived, with some having reproductive tissue. Synthesis. Our findings incorporate the importance of nursery grounds for tropical herbivores and herbivory refugia for kelp individuals into the tropicalization model, where the former increases the resilience of canopy-free states and the latter might facilitate recovering kelp populations. The restoration of abundant warm-resistant kelp populations in shelters could provide local sources of propagules to recolonize open spaces; however, our results suggest that the reduction of herbivory and the provision of turf-free substratum would be necessary to boost the recovery of kelp forests.",,,,"; Bennett, Scott/A-8747-2016; Wernberg, Thomas/B-4172-2010","Bosch Guerra, Nestor Echedey/0000-0003-0421-8456; Bennett, Scott/0000-0003-2969-7430; Wernberg, Thomas/0000-0003-1185-9745; Zarco-Perello, Salvador/0000-0001-9435-8545",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,MAY,2021,109,5,,,,,2081,2094,,10.1111/1365-2745.13621,,MAR 2021,,,,,WOS:000624971200001,,,,,,

Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are ecosystem engineers in the boreal woodlands, a nutrient-poor environment, where their denning activity increases soil nutrient concentrations, affecting the diversity of vegetation around dens. Since dens can persist for many decades and tree growth is enhanced on dens, dens can be used to study the long term impacts of nutrient additions on community and ecosystem processes. We examined the reproductive output of a mast-seeding conifer, white spruce (Picea glauca), on 10 red fox dens and paired control sites at the boreal treeline near Churchill, Manitoba, in July 2019. We estimated cone production in both the current non-mast year (2019) and the previous mast year. The number of cones produced per tree and per hectare was significantly higher on dens than control sites in the non-mast year, but did not differ in the mast year. Higher cone production on dens was partly driven by trees being larger on dens. These results suggest that red fox ecosystem engineering activity affects white spruce reproduction, since increased soil nutrients on dens allow for higher cone production, but the effect of red fox denning is limited by interactions with mast-seeding mechanisms. For example, weather cues may override the effects of denning in mast years, while trees on dens may be able to allocate more resources to reproduction in non-mast years, but store the same amount of resources as trees off dens to produce similarly large cone crops in mast years. Altered resource availability in this nutrient-limited landscape could have additional ecological implications, by affecting the foraging patterns of seed predators and spruce range expansion.

The Cape York Peninsula track is contemporary, characterised by ongoing genetic exchange, whereas the Kimberley Plateau track is historic, facilitated by multiple past exposures of the Arafura Shelf during the Pleistocene.

Methods Using past (1970-1977) and recently updated (2003-2015) forest inventories across 761,100 km(2), we first quantified latitudinal shifts for saplings of eight tree species and investigated colonization events at migration sites. We used field evidence and a consensus modelling approach to determine environmental suitability and identify edaphic, climatic and disturbance conditions, as well as species co-occurrence patterns, characterizing recent colonization events. The results were interpreted in relation to novel species associations facilitating species migration in unsuitable landscapes. Results All species showed northward latitudinal shifts driven by increased recruitment and colonization northward. Colonization events occurred largely at historically unsuitable sites. Migration sites showed a shift towards humus types characteristic of the boreal forest and not typically found in the core range of most temperate species. Climatic conditions at migration sites were initially colder than at occupied sites, but warming suggests recent climatic suitability. A decrease in conifer basal area at migration sites following disturbances reduced priority effects that possibly constrained deciduous species establishment. Co-occurrence patterns pointed to deciduous species tolerant of boreal edaphic conditions, leading the way for other temperate species.

Understanding how selective processes alter expansion speed is thus critical to predicting both the spread of invasive species and responses to climate change. Theory predicts evolution of increased dispersal and fecundity at the leading edge of expansions. However, these traits are often negatively correlated, and what conditions might lead to one trait being favoured over the other are unclear. Further, while most theory assumes populations spread through homogeneously favourable environments, how selective processes acting on dispersal and fecundity alter expansion dynamics in patchy landscapes is not well understood. We investigated the role of landscape fragmentation and trait correlations in determining evolutionary trajectories at the leading edge of range expansions, and how these in turn alter expansion speed. We simulated populations with heritable trade-offs between dispersal and fecundity spreading through one-dimensional landscapes with varying degrees of fragmentation. We found that, in populations with a weak trade-off, the strongest dispersers were selected for at the leading edge. However, in highly fragmented landscapes and with a strong trade-off, fecundity was instead favoured. Expansion speed was strongly correlated with dispersal ability at the leading edge at all levels of patchiness, and variation in expansion speed across replicates increased with fragmentation and trade-off strength. Our findings demonstrate that evolution induced by both landscape structure and trait correlations can alter spread dynamics, and that selective processes imposed by spread per se may not always be dominant in influencing expansion speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1874-1738,1874-1746,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s12080-021-00503-z,,FEB 2021,,,,,WOS:000622270300001,,,,,,

Results Both cpDNA and nuclear SNP data showed genetic differentiation between two disjunct regions. However, cpDNA data indicated genetic differentiation within the Ryukyu Islands but not within the Izu Islands, while nuclear SNP data indicated genetic differentiation within both island groups. Ecological niche modelling showed that both the Izu and Ryukyu archipelagos had contained some islands with a climate compatible with modern M japonica climate envelopes despite climate oscillations. Main conclusions Islands within both the Izu and Ryukyu archipelagos may have supported M japonica populations throughout historical climate oscillations.

As introduced, populations increase in abundance and geographical range, so does the potential for negative impacts on native communities. As such, there is a need to better understand the processes driving range expansion as species become established in recipient landscapes. Through an investigation into capacity for population growth and range expansion of introduced populations of a non-native lizard (Podarcis muralis), we aimed to demonstrate how multi-scale factors influence spatial spread, population growth, and invasion potential in introduced species. We collated location records of P. muralis presence in England, UK through data collected from field surveys and a citizen science campaign. We used these data as input for presence-background models to predict areas of climate suitability at a national-scale (5 km resolution), and fine-scale habitat suitability at the local scale (2 m resolution). We then integrated local models into an individual-based modeling platform to simulate population dynamics and forecast range expansion for 10 populations in heterogeneous landscapes. National-scale models indicated climate suitability has restricted the species to the southern parts of the UK, primarily by a latitudinal cline in overwintering conditions. Patterns of population growth and range expansion were related to differences in local landscape configuration and heterogeneity. Growth curves suggest populations could be in the early stages of exponential growth. However, annual rates of range expansion are predicted to be low (5-16 m). We conclude that extensive nationwide range expansion through secondary introduction is likely to be restricted by currently unsuitable climate beyond southern regions of the UK. However, exponential growth of local populations in habitats providing transport pathways is likely to increase opportunities for regional expansion.

Despite the significant hurdles associated with adapting to a resistant host, viruses are evolutionarily successful and maintain stable coevolutionary relationships with their hosts. To investigate the factors underlying how pathogens adapt to their hosts, we performed a deep mutational scan of the region of the lambda tail fiber tip protein that mediates contact with the receptor on lambda's host, Escherichia coli. Phages harboring amino acid substitutions were subjected to selection for infectivity on wild type E. coli, revealing a highly restrictive fitness landscape, in which most substitutions completely abrogate function. A subset of positions that are tolerant of mutation in this assay, but diverse over evolutionary time, are associated with host range expansion. Imposing selection for phage infectivity on three lambda-resistant hosts, each harboring a different missense mutation in the lambda receptor, reveals hundreds of adaptive variants in lambda. We distinguish lambda variants that confer promiscuity, a general ability to overcome host resistance, from those that drive host-specific infectivity.

We described and compared the microhabitats used by the species for egg laying with those available across the study sites both in edge and in core populations. We carried out an ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA) to estimate (1) the variety of microhabitats used by the butterfly for egg laying (tolerance) and (2) the extent to which these selected microhabitats deviated from those available (marginality). Microhabitat availability was similar in edge and core populations. Ambient temperature recorded at the site level above the vegetation was on average lower at core populations. In contrast with what is often assumed, edge populations did not have narrower microhabitat use compared to core populations. Females in edge populations even showed a higher degree of generalism: They laid eggs under a wider range of microhabitats. We suggest that this pattern could be related to an overrepresentation of fast deciding personalities in edge populations. We also showed that the thermal time window for active female behavior was reduced in edge populations, which could significantly decrease the time budget for oviposition and decrease the threshold of acceptance during microhabitat selection for oviposition in recently established populations.",,,,"Titeux, Nicolas/G-4723-2016","Titeux, Nicolas/0000-0002-7719-7417",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,MAR,2021,11,5,,,,,2336,2345,,10.1002/ece3.7202,,FEB 2021,,,,,WOS:000616904800001,33717459,,,,,

Predictions for range expansions include a loss of genetic diversity and an accumulation of deleterious alleles along the expansion axis, which can decrease fitness at the range-front (expansion load). In plants, empirical studies supporting expansion load are scarce, and its effects remain to be tested outside a few model species. Leontodon longirostris is a colonizing Asteraceae with a widespread distribution in the Western Mediterranean, providing a particularly interesting system to gain insight into the factors that can enhance or mitigate expansion load. In this study, we produced a first genome draft for the species, covering 418 Mbp (similar to 53% of the genome). Although incomplete, this draft was suitable to design a targeted sequencing of similar to 1.5 Mbp in 238 L. longirostris plants from 21 populations distributed along putative colonization routes in the Iberian Peninsula. Inferred demographic history supports a range expansion from southern Iberia around 40,000 years ago, reaching northern Iberia around 25,000 years ago. The expansion was accompanied by a loss of genetic diversity and a significant increase in the proportion of putatively deleterious mutations.

Parawixia bistriata is a colonial spider inhabiting seasonal dry forests and mesic habitats in South America. Individuals capture prey as a group, which allows individuals to broaden their foraging niche by incorporating large prey that cannot be subdued in solitary captures. P. bistriata exhibits two behavioural ecotypes a dry (plastic) ecotype which modifies individual's tendency to capture prey in a group depending on food resources and a wet (fixed) ecotype, whose tendency to group prey capture is only modulated by the size of the prey but not by prey availability. By reconstructing the range expansion of the species using phylogeographic and species distribution modelling techniques, we indirectly examined whether group prey capture could have helped P. bistriata in colonization of low resource habitats. Based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene genealogy, we found older populations in northern Cerrado in Brazil with more recent populations located further south in Dry and Humid Chaco in Argentina, with the latter being the most derived. Species distribution modelling for each ecotype suggests that suitable habitat for each ecotype started to overlap at some point during the Last Glacial Maximum (21 ky BP). These results suggest that P. bistriata expanded from northern Cerrado south to the Gran Chaco, being able to colonize mesic habitats at a later stage when individuals reached southern territories in the Chaco. This evidence is opposite to the idea that GPC facilitated P. bistriata colonization from mesic to harsher environments.

Previous work assessed the population structure and estimated the long-term effective population sizes of the populations present in the United States, but the source of the initial introduction(s) to the U.S. remains unidentified.

Reversed expansion from temperate to pan-tropic climates through a polyploidization-driven shift in heat tolerance remains largely unknown. Here, we found autopolyploidy in relation to the global expansion of Solidago canadensis from its temperate-climate native range in North American to hot-summer climate in an introduced range. Our cytogeographical study of 2,062 accessions from 471 locations worldwide demonstrates that ploidy levels correlate negatively with latitude and positively with average temperature. An isotherm-dependent shift of the climate niches at the threshold of 20 degrees-24 degrees C between geo-cytotypes can be attributed mainly to autopolyploidy-driven differentiation of heat tolerance; only polyploids and not diploids are able to complete sexual reproduction, germinate, and grow in the hot-summer climate of low latitudes. Ploidy-dependent fertility appears to play a key role in the hot-summer introduced range in the northern hemisphere through both pre-adaptation and rapid post-introduction adaptive evolution of delayed flowering and improved heat tolerance during embryo development.

Such evolutionary rescue is particularly relevant when the threat comes from changing environments, or when long-term population persistence requires range expansion into new habitats. Conservation biologists are therefore often interested in whether or not populations or lineages show a disposition for adaptive evolution, that is, if they are evolvable. Here, we discuss four alternative perspectives that target different causes of evolvability and outline some of the key challenges those perspectives are designed to address. Standing genetic variation provides one familiar estimate of evolvability. Yet, the mere presence of genetic variation is often insufficient to predict if a population will adapt, or how it will adapt. The reason is that adaptive change not only depends on genetic variation, but also on the extent to which this genetic variation can be realized as adaptive phenotypic variation. This requires attention to developmental systems and how plasticity influences evolutionary potential.

Our results show the trajectory from specialized one-speed genomes (sects. Citrinae and Paspalorum) towards adaptive two-speed genomes (sects.

Instead, the origin and diversification of the genus Acusta was dated to the late Miocene-Pliocene from an area around North and Northeast China to South China and East Asian islands Three major evolutionary lineages were identified. Two of the major lineages demonstrate distinct evolutionary histories, as sympatric speciation is the major speciation process for the continental Glade, while the insular Glade originated from founder events. Taiwan functioned as an important source of diversification for species on the East Asian islands possibly through passive dispersal of different mechanisms.

In the dynamic 21st century however, the configuration and quality of these rangelands is changing rapidly. Climate change processes, human range expansion, and the fragmentation and degradation of rangeland habitat have increased competition between pastoralist livestock and wildlife. Interactions of this type are particularly apparent in East Africa, and perhaps most obvious in northern Kenya. In 2017, following months of intense drought, a pastoralist incursion of a protected area (Loisaba Conservancy) occurred in Laikipia County, Kenya. An estimated 40,000 livestock were herded onto the conservancy by armed pastoralists where the cattle were grazed for approximately three months. Using 53 camera trap sites across the 226 km(2) conservancy, we quantified spatial patterns in site visitation rates (via spatially-explicit, temporally-dynamic Bayesian models) for seven species of large mammalian herbivores in the three-month period directly before, during, and after the incursion. We detected significant changes in space use of all large mammalian herbivores during the incursion. Furthermore, these patterns did not return to their pre-incursion state in the three-month period after the pastoralists and their livestock left the conservancy. Thus, in addition to reduced site vitiation rates for these large mammalian herbivores, we also detected considerable displacement in response to the livestock incursion. Our results illustrate that pastoralist incursions can cause large-scale disruptions of wildlife space use, supporting the notion that livestock can competitively exclude large mammalian herbivores from grazing access.

Here, we examined herbaceous hydrangeas of genus Deinanthe in East Asia, which show limited distributions and a remarkable disjunction between Japan and central China. Chloroplast genome and restriction site-associated DNA sequencing revealed that speciation event occurred in the late Miocene (ca. 7-9 Mya) in response to global climate change. Two lineages apparently remained not branched until the middle Quaternary, and afterwards started to diverge to regional population groups.

We modelled the distributions of 15 non-native invasive grass and forb species of concern in western North America to define their environmental niches and predict potential invasion risk. Location: Arid and semi-arid western United States. Methods: We modelled species distribution using presence/absence data from > 148,000 vegetation survey plots to predict the probability of presence of each species based on associated climate, soil, topography and disturbance records. Boosted regression tree models were trained and tested within a buffer distance from presence observations of each species. Buffers were optimized by adding absence observations from increasingly large areas until prediction of presence was maximized, as defined by the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). We evaluated model AUPRC and other metrics by cross-validation within training areas, then projected final models within focal EPA level III ecoregions. Results: Focal species were present in 2.7% to 21% of plots within model training areas of 40 to 340 km radius. Models conservatively estimated potential species presence, with typically low false positive rates and moderate sensitivity. The most influential predictors of presence included minimum temperature (especially for grasses), climatic water deficit, precipitation seasonality and fire history. Cold desert ecoregions were impacted by the most species, with predicted range expansion into the prairie ecoregions and infilling for Warm Desert species. Main conclusions: Invasive forb and grass species are likely to expand their ranges and continued increases in temperature, aridity and area burned will increase invasion risk. Monitoring species presence and absence and mapping known and potential ranges with a focus on presence detection, as in our methodology, will aid in identifying new invasions and prioritizing prevention and control.",,,,,"Urza, Alexandra/0000-0001-9795-6735",,,,,,,,,,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,,,APR,2021,27,4,,,,,710,728,,10.1111/ddi.13232,,JAN 2021,,,,,WOS:000611868500001,,,,,,

Species interactions are often context-dependent and the relative importance of biotic assistance versus resistance could vary with abiotic conditions or the life stage of the invading species, as invader stress tolerances and resource requirements change with ontogeny. In northeast Florida salt marshes, the abundant dead litter (wrack) of the native marsh cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, could influence the expansion success of the black mangrove, Avicennia germinans, a tropical species that is expanding its range northward. We used two field experiments to examine how S. alterniflora wrack affects A. germinans success during (a) propagule establishment and (b) subsequent seedling survival. We also conducted laboratory feeding assays to identify propagule consumers and assess how wrack presence influences herbivory on mangrove propagules. Spartina alterniflora wrack facilitated A. germinans establishment by promoting propagule recruitment, retention and rooting; the tidal regime influenced the magnitude of these effects. However, over time S. alterniflora wrack inhibited A. germinans seedling success by smothering seedlings and attracting herbivore consumers. Feeding assays identified rodents-which seek refuge in wrack-as consumers of A. germinans propagules. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the deleterious effects of S. alterniflora wrack on A. germinans seedling survival counterbalance the initial beneficial effects of wrack on A. germinans seed establishment. Such seed-seedling conflicts can arise when species stress tolerances and resource requirements change throughout development and vary with abiotic conditions. In concert with the tidal conditions, the relative importance of positive and negative interactions with wrack at each life stage can influence the rate of local and regional mangrove expansion. Because interaction strengths can change in direction and magnitude with ontogeny, it is essential to examine resident-invader interactions at multiple life stages and across environmental gradients to uncover the mechanisms of biotic assistance and resistance during invasion.",,,,,"Byers, James/0000-0001-9240-0287; Smith, Rachel/0000-0002-8713-126X; Blaze, Julie/0000-0002-1387-6154",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,APR,2021,109,4,,,,,1649,1664,,10.1111/1365-2745.13586,,JAN 2021,,,,,WOS:000611226700001,,,,,,

During invasions, species can interact, potentially resulting in hybridization. Here, we examined two Cakile species, C. edentula and C. maritima (Brassicaceae), that co-occur and may hybridize during range expansion in separate regions of the globe. Cakile edentula invaded each location first, while C. maritima established later, apparently replacing the former. We assessed the evidence for hybridization in western North America and Australia, where both species have been introduced, and identified source populations with 4561 SNPs using Genotype-by-Sequencing. Our results indicate that C. edentula in Australia originated from one region of eastern North America while in western North America it is probably from multiple sources. Cakile maritima in Australia is derived from at least two different parts of Europe while the introduction in western North America is from one. Although morphological evidence of hybridization is generally limited to mixed species populations in Australia and virtually absent elsewhere, our genetic analysis revealed relatively high levels of hybridization in Australia (58% hybrids using Admixture) and supported the presence of hybrids in western North America (16% hybrids using Admixture) and New Zealand. Hybrids might be commonly overlooked in invaders, as identification based solely on morphological traits may represent only the tip of the iceberg.

As invading organisms often encounter new habitats during colonization, they will experience novel selection pressures. Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus complex) have recently colonized large parts of Switzerland and are invasive in Lake Constance. Introduced to several watersheds roughly 150 years ago, they spread across the Swiss Plateau (400-800 m a.s.l.), bringing three divergent hitherto allopatric lineages into secondary contact. As stickleback have colonized a variety of different habitat types during this recent range expansion, the Swiss system is a useful model for studying contemporary evolution with and without secondary contact. For example, in the Lake Constance region there has been rapid phenotypic and genetic divergence between a lake population and some stream populations. There is considerable phenotypic variation within the lake population, with individuals foraging in and occupying littoral, offshore pelagic, and profundal waters, the latter of which is a very unusual habitat for stickleback. Furthermore, adults from the lake population can reach up to three times the size of adults from the surrounding stream populations, and are large by comparison to populations globally. Here, we review the historical origins of the threespine stickleback in Switzerland, and the ecomorphological variation and genomic basis of its invasion in Lake Constance.

This is also true for harmful algal blooms, which have been reported to have increased in frequency. However, this research is challenging due to the ephemeral nature, small size and mostly low concentrations of microalgae in the environment. One such species is the nuisance microalga Gonyostomum semen (Raphidophyceae), which has increased in occurrence in northern Europe in recent decades. The question of whether the species has expanded its habitat range or if it was already present in the lakes but was too rare to be detected remains unanswered. The aim of the present study was to determine the genetic structure and dispersal pathways of G. semen using RAD (restriction-site-associated DNA) tag sequencing. For G. semen, which has a huge genome (32 Gbp), we faced particular challenges, but were nevertheless able to recover over 1000 single nucleotide polymorphisms at high coverage. Our data revealed a distinct population genetic structure, demonstrating a divide of western and eastern populations that probably represent different lineages. Despite significant genetic differentiation among lakes, we found only limited isolation-by-distance. While we had expected a pattern of recent expansion northwards, the data demonstrated gene flow from the northeast/east towards the southwest/west. This genetic signature suggests that the observed gene flow may be due to dispersal by autumn migratory birds, which act as dispersal vectors of resistant resting propagules that form at the end of the G. semen blooms.",,,,"; Certnerova, Dora/I-6567-2016; Cresko, William/H-4010-2014","Gollnisch, Raphael/0000-0001-6177-8877; Certnerova, Dora/0000-0001-8219-554X; Rengefors, Karin/0000-0001-6297-9734; Cresko, William/0000-0002-3496-8074",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-1083,1365-294X,,,,FEB,2021,30,4,,,,,912,925,,10.1111/mec.15787,,JAN 2021,,,,,WOS:000608818100001,33386639,,,,,

We used a manipulative, factorial field experiment to quantify the effects of soil environment and precipitation (the putatively overriding climatic factor) on plant lifetime fitness outside the geographic range boundary of a native California annual plant. We grew plants outside the range edge in large mesocosms filled with soil from either within or outside the range, and plants were subjected to either a low (ambient) or high (supplemental) spring precipitation treatment. Soil environment had large effects on plant lifetime fitness that were similar in magnitude to the effects of precipitation. Moreover, mean fitness of plants grown with within-range soil in the low precipitation treatment approximated that of plants grown with beyond-range soil in the high precipitation treatment. The positive effects of within-range soil persisted in the second, wetter year of the experiment, though the magnitude of the soil effect was smaller than in the first, drier year.

We investigated whether land cover and human population density changes are related to the relative probability of occurrence of three European large carnivores: the grey wolf (Canis lupus), the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) and the brown bear (Ursus arctos). Location: Europe, west of 64 degrees longitude. Methods: We fitted multi-temporal species distribution models using >50,000 occurrence points with time series of land cover, landscape configuration, protected areas, hunting regulations and human population density covering a 24-year period (1992-2015). Within the temporal window considered, we then predicted changes in habitat suitability for large carnivores throughout Europe. Results: Between 1992 and 2015, the habitat suitability for the three species increased in Eastern Europe, the Balkans, North-West Iberian Peninsula and Northern Scandinavia, but showed mixed trends in Western and Southern Europe. These trends were primarily associated with increases in forest cover and decreases in human population density, and, additionally, with decreases in the cover of mosaics of cropland and natural vegetation. Main conclusions: Recent land cover and human population changes appear to have altered the habitat suitability pattern for large carnivores in Europe, whereas protection level did not play a role. While projected changes largely match the observed recovery of large carnivore populations, we found mismatches with the recent expansion of wolves in Central and Southern Europe, where factors not included in our models may have played a dominant role.

More precisely, we expose simulated trophic networks of co-evolving consumers to warming under different evolutionary scenarios, which allows us to assess the effect of evolution on diversity maintenance. We also investigate how the evolution of body mass and feeding preference affects coexistence within a simplified consumer-resource module. Our simulations predict that the long-term diversity loss triggered by warming is considerably higher in scenarios where evolution is slowed down or switched off completely, indicating that eco-evolutionary feedback indeed helps to preserve biodiversity. However, even with fast evolution, food webs still experience vast disruptions in their structure and functioning. Reversing warming may thus not be sufficient to restore previous structures.

Blue catfish exhibited routine metabolic rates similar to those of other benthic fishes but below the more active species.

Here, we explore whether dispersing individuals exhibit behavioral types that differ from those remaining in the source population. We investigated a feral population of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) that undergoes a yearly range shift cycle. Guppies are among the most widespread invasive species in the world, but in temperate regions these tropical fish can only survive in winter-warm freshwaters. Established in a thermally-altered stream in Germany, guppies are confined to a warm-water influx in winter, but can spread to peripheral parts as these become thermally accessible. We sampled fish from the source population and a winter-abandoned site in March, June and August. Fish were tested for boldness, sociability and activity involving open-field tests including interactions with a robotic social partner. Guppies differed consistently among each other in all three traits within each sample. Average trait expression in the source population differed across seasons, however, we could not detect differences between source and downstream population. Instead, all populations exhibited a remarkably stable behavioral syndrome between boldness and activity despite strong seasonal changes in water temperature and associated environmental factors. We conclude that random drift (opposed to personality-biased dispersal) is a more likely dispersal mode for guppies, at least in the investigated stream.

Our results indicate that emperor geese are arriving at wintering areas earlier and spending more time at these areas than in the past. Our comparisons among historical aerial and ground surveys suggests that increasing numbers of emperor geese are wintering closer to breeding areas in western Alaska; a change likely related to increasing habitat availability due to shifting environmental conditions. Our results also showed that fewer emperor geese are using an area in the core of their wintering range, suggesting either decreased habitat quality or a reduction in migration distance via alternative wintering locations. Overall, our study highlights a rapid response to apparent habitat change likely due to warming temperatures and a reduction in ice cover and emphasizes the importance of understanding complex interactions among migration distance, the environment, and habitat in interpreting site selection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2351-9894,,,,,JAN,2021,25,,,,,,,,e01397,10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e01397,,,,,,,WOS:000615948300016,,,,,,

Anthropogenic disturbance is usually measured via structural proxies such as infrastructure and land use that overlook the impact of human presence, or functional disturbance. In this study, we propose a methodology unifying two paradigms, human mobility and animal movement, to fill this gap. We developed a novel spatially-explicit index of anthropic disturbance, the Cumulative Outdoor activity Index (COI), and validated it with ground truth observations derived from camera trapping (r = +0.63, p < 0.001). Building on previous work from Peters et al. (2015, Biol. Cons. 186, 123-133) on a Critically Endangered brown bear population in the Alps, we used Resource Selection Analysis to assess the influence of different forms of anthropogenic disturbance on the relative probability of habitat selection. The intensity of COI provided an effective measure of functional anthropogenic disturbance, and it outperformed all alternative and commonly-used proxies of structural disturbance in predicting bear habitat use. Our predictions suggest that brown bear shrinks its ecological niche as a consequence of intense human use of otherwise suitable habitat. These constraints may limit the potential range expansion of bears to establish a viable Alpine-Dinaric metapopulation. Conclusive conservation and future land use planning towards human-wildlife coexistence should account for the functional presence of humans on the landscape.

However, current implementations are still time and resource consuming. In addition, bioinformatic processing is contentious and its impact on downstream analyses is insufficiently understood. Here we employ ddRAD sequencing and a thorough sampling for species delimitation in Zodarion styliferum, a widespread Iberian ant-eating spider. We explore the influence of the loci filtering strategy on the downstream phylogenetic analyses, genomic clustering and coalescent species delimitation. We also assess the accuracy of one mitochondrial (COI) and one nuclear (ITS) barcode for fast and inexpensive species delineation in the group. Our genomic data strongly support two morphologically cryptic but ecologically divergent lineages, mainly restricted to the central-eastern and western parts of the Iberian Peninsula, respectively. Larger matrices with more missing data showed increased genomic diversity, supporting that bioinformatic strategies to maximize matrix completion disproportionately exclude loci with the highest mutation rates. Moderate loci filtering gave the best results across analyses: although larger matrices returned concatenated phylogenies with higher support, middle-sized matrices performed better in genetic structure analyses. COI displayed high diversity and a conspicuous barcode gap, revealing 13 mitochondrial lineages. Mitonuclear discordance is consistent with ancestral isolation in multiple groups, probably in glacial refugia, followed by range expansion and secondary contact that produced genomic homogenization. Several apparently (unidirectionally) introgressed specimens further challenge the accuracy of species identification through mitochondrial barcodes in the group. Conversely, ITS failed to separate both lineages of Z. styliferum. This study shows an extreme case of mitonuclear discordance that highlights the limitations of single molecular barcodes for species delimitation, even in presence of distinct barcode gaps, and brings new light on the effects of parameterization on shallow-divergence studies using RAD data.",,,,"Alvarez, Nadir/B-4318-2010","Alvarez, Nadir/0000-0002-0729-166X",,,,,,,,,,,,1055-7903,1095-9513,,,,JAN,2021,154,,,,,,,,106997,10.1016/j.ympev.2020.106997,,,,,,,WOS:000597412500001,33164854,,,,,

Prominent examples are invasions by species of the genera Spartina, Phragmites and Elymus. The responsible physiological and ecological drivers of these invasions are poorly understood. Physiological integration (PI) is a key trait of clonal plants, which enables the exchange of resources among ramets. We investigated PI in Elymus athericus, which has been rapidly spreading from high-marsh into low-marsh environments of European salt marshes during the last decades. We applied a nitrogen stable-isotope approach to trace nutrient translocation between ramets in a factorial mesocosm experiment. The experiment was set up to mimic an invasion pattern commonly found in tidal wetlands, i.e. from high-elevated and rarely flooded into low-elevated and frequently flooded microenvironments. We tested for intraspecific variability in PI by including two genotypes of Elymus that naturally occur at different elevations within the tidal frame, a high-marsh (HM) and a low-marsh (LM) genotype. PI strongly increased offspring ramet aboveground and belowground biomass by 62 and 81%, respectively. Offspring ramets under drained conditions had 95% greater belowground biomass than those under flooded conditions. LM genotype offspring ramets produced 27% more aboveground biomass than HM genotypes. Offspring ramets were clearly more enriched in N-15 under flooded versus drained conditions; however, this positive effect of flooding on delta N-15 was only significant in the LM genotype. Our findings demonstrate the importance of PI for the growth of Elymus offspring ramets and thereby for the species' capacity for fast vegetative spread. We show that offspring ramets under stressful flooded conditions are more dependent on nutrient supply from parent ramets than those under drained conditions. Our data furthermore suggest a higher degree of adaptation to flooding via PI in the LM versus HM genotype.

Such changes are already evident in high latitude forests, where waterlogged soils produced by topography, surficial geology, and permafrost are an important driver of forest dynamics. Predicting such effects under the novel conditions of the future requires models with direct and mechanistic links of abiotic drivers to growth and competition. We enhanced such a forest landscape model (PnET-Succession in LANDIS-II) to allow simulation of waterlogged soils and their effects on tree growth and competition. We formally tested how these modifications alter water balance on wetland and permafrost sites, and their effect on tree growth and competition. We applied the model to evaluate its promise for mechanistically simulating species range expansion and contraction under climate change across a latitudinal gradient in Siberian Russia. We found that higher emissions scenarios permitted range expansions that were quicker and allowed a greater diversity of invading species, especially at the highest latitudes, and that disturbance hastened range shifts by overcoming the natural inertia of established ecological communities. The primary driver of range advances to the north was altered hydrology related to thawing permafrost, followed by temperature effects on growth. Range contractions from the south (extirpations) were slower and less tied to emissions or latitude, and were driven by inability to compete with invaders, or disturbance. An important non-intuitive result was that some extant species were killed off by extreme cold events projected under climate change as greater weather extremes occurred over the next 30 years, and this had important effects on subsequent successional trajectories. The mechanistic linkages between climate and soil water dynamics in this forest landscape model produced tight links between climate inputs, physiology of vegetation, and soils at a monthly time step.

Invasive populations are reproductively successful, and landscape change may buoy this success. We show how modeling the spatial structure of reproductive success can elucidate the mechanisms of range shifts and sustained invasions for mammalian species with attendant young. We use an example of white-tailed deer (deer; Odocoileus virginianus) expansion in the Nearctic boreal forest, a North American phenomenon implicated in severe declines of threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus). We hypothesized that deer reproductive success is linked to forage subsidies provided by extensive landscape change via resource extraction. We measured deer occurrence using data from 62 camera traps in northern Alberta, Canada, over three years. We weighed support for multiple competing hypotheses about deer reproductive success using multistate occupancy models and generalized linear models in an AIC-based model selection framework. Spatial patterns of reproductive success were best explained by features associated with petroleum exploration and extraction, which offer early-seral vegetation resource subsidies. Effect sizes of anthropogenic features eclipsed natural heterogeneity by two orders of magnitude. We conclude that anthropogenic early-seral forage subsidies support high springtime reproductive success, mitigating or exceeding winter losses, maintaining populations. Synthesis and Applications.

A pattern in nature that may give insight to processes that shape the distribution and abundance of polyploids is that polyploid populations are sometimes associated with peripheral habitats within the range of a species of mixed ploidy. Here, adaptation and competition of a diploid versus an autotetraploid population in a peripheral habitat are examined theoretically. It is shown that a nascent autotetraploid population adapts to and outcompetes a diploid population in the periphery when the rate of gamete dispersal is high, and when the mode of gene action is recessive for moderate to high rates of selfing. With additive or dominant modes of gene action, the conditions for an autotetraploid to outcompete a diploid in the periphery appear determined more by the rate of selfing and less by gamete dispersal. All of these results are based on empirical work that suggests inbreeding depression is higher in diploids versus autotetraploids. Generally, the results indicate that, although autotetraploids incur minority cytotype exclusion, diploids face burdens themselves. In the case of adaptation to a peripheral habitat, this burden is migration load from gamete and propagule dispersal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0014-3820,1558-5646,,,,JAN,2021,75,1,,,,,39,55,,10.1111/evo.14127,,DEC 2020,,,,,WOS:000598740200001,33259069,,,,,

Fast ecological responses closely track climate change, slow responses substantively lag climate forcing, causing disequilibria and reduced fitness, and abrupt responses are characterized by nonlinear, threshold-type responses at rates that are large relative to background variability and forcing. All three kinds of climate-driven ecological dynamics are well documented in contemporary studies, palaeoecology and invasion biology. This fast-slow-abrupt conceptual framework helps unify a bifurcated climate-change literature, which tends to separately consider the ecological risks posed by slow or abrupt ecological dynamics. Given the prospect of ongoing climate change for the next several decades to centuries of the Anthropocene and wide variations in ecological rates of change, the theory and practice of managing ecological systems should shift attention from target states to target rates. A rates-focused framework broadens the strategic menu for managers to include options to both slow and accelerate ecological rates of change, seeks to reduce mismatch among climate and ecological rates of change, and provides a unified conceptual framework for tackling the distinct risks associated with fast, slow and abrupt ecological rates of change.",,,,"Ordonez, Alejandro/ABH-2824-2020; Svenning, Jens-Christian/C-8977-2012","Ordonez, Alejandro/0000-0003-2873-4551; Svenning, Jens-Christian/0000-0002-3415-0862; Williams, John/0000-0001-6046-9634",,,,,,,,,,,,2397-334X,,,,,JAN,2021,5,1,,,,,17,26,,10.1038/s41559-020-01344-5,,DEC 2020,,,,,WOS:000599001800001,33288870,,,,,

However, major limitations to understanding are usually a lack of spatiotemporal population data and information on the populations' colonisation history. In a large-scale, detailed study on the bush-cricket Metrioptera roeselii 70 groups of founders were introduced in areas outside the species' distribution range. We examined how (1) the number of founders (2-32 individuals), (2) the time since establishment (7 or 15 years after introduction) and (3) possible gene flow affected establishment success and temporal genetic changes of the introduced populations. We found higher establishment success in introductions with larger propagule sizes but genetic diversity indices were only partly correlated to propagule size. As expected, introduced populations were more similar to their founder population the larger the propagule size was. However, even if apparent at first, most of the differentiation in the small propagule introductions disappeared over time. Surprisingly, genetic variability was regained to a level comparable to the large and outbreeding founder population only 15 generations after severe demographic bottlenecks. We suggest that the establishment of these populations could be a result of several mechanisms acting in synergy. Here, rapid increase in genetic diversity of few introductions could potentially be attributed to limited gene flow from adjacent populations, behavioural adaptations and/or even increased mutation rate.

Factors including temperature and depth can structure Arctic and Subarctic fjord benthic communities, but the response of scavenging communities to these factors is poorly known. To address this, we compared scavenging fauna in eight fjords with different physical characteristics in Svalbard and northern Norway using time-lapse imagery of scavengers consuming Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) bait. Fjords influenced by relatively warm Atlantic waters, both in Norway and Svalbard, had high scavenger richness. However, Svalbard fjords with negative bottom temperatures had the lowest species richness and were dominated by lysianassoid amphipods and ophiuroids. In these cold Svalbard fjords, the mean carrion removal rates were almost 20 times higher than mean values noted elsewhere, except in the warm Norwegian fjord Kaldfjorden. Amphipods and ophiuroids quickly reduced the bait to bones (207.6-304.7 g removed per hour (g h(-1)); mean 290.6 +/- 7.3 g h(-1), n = 4) in cold Svalbard fjords. In the warmer Svalbard fjords, carrion removal rates were low (0-51.5 g h(-1); mean 14.6 +/- 9.0 g h(-1), n = 5). Carrion removal rates in Kaldfjorden were higher than other Atlantic Water influenced fjords (132.1 and 372.5 g h(-1), n = 2) owing to the scavenging activity of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua).

New thermal environments in the invaded range will be particularly challenging for ectotherms, as their metabolism directly depends on environmental temperature. However, we know little about the role climatic niche shifts play in the invasion process, and the underlining physiological mechanisms. We tested if a thermal niche shift accompanies an invasion, and if native and introduced populations differ in their ability to acclimate thermal limits. We used an alien ant species-Tapinoma magnum-which recently started to spread across Europe. Using occurrence data and accompanying climatic variables, we measured the amount of overlap between thermal niches in the native and invaded range. We then experimentally tested the acclimation ability in native and introduced populations by incubating T. magnum at 18, 25 and 30 degrees C. We measured upper and lower critical thermal limits after 7 and 21 days. We found that T. magnum occupies a distinct thermal niche in its introduced range, which is on average 3.5 degrees C colder than its native range. Critical thermal minimum did not differ between populations from the two ranges when colonies were maintained at 25 or 30 degrees C, but did differ after colony acclimation at a lower temperature. We found twofold greater acclimation ability of introduced populations to lower temperatures, after prolonged incubation at 18 degrees C. Increased acclimation ability of lower thermal limits could explain the expansion of the realized thermal niche in the invaded range, and likely contributed to the spread of this species to cooler climates.

However, there is limited understanding of the sensitivity of existing biomonitoring tools to invasive species in rivers; and even less known regarding how they influence community taxonomic and functional measures. This research explores the response of freshwater macroinvertebrate communities to biological invasion using taxonomic and functional indices. Utilising a long-term dataset (spanning 2000-2019, 5,988 samples) from rivers in England, the performance of four biomonitoring tools (WHPT, WHPT-ASPT, LIFE and PSI) and two community functional indices (functional richness and redundancy) was examined before and after the colonisation of the invasive species, Dikerogammarus haemobaphes (Eichwald, 1841; Crustacea: Gammaridae). This species represents a recent (first record 2012) and highly successful invader, allowing its range expansion within waterbodies to be examined in detail. Spatial (national and basin level) and seasonal (spring and autumn) effects were investigated using a before-after control-impact (BACI) experimental framework and linear mixed effects models. Results indicated that invasion by D. haemobaphes resulted in significant reductions to the WHPT index and functional diversity metrics (richness and redundancy) while more subtle patterns were observed for other metrics. Analysis of seasonal and individual river basins (River Trent and R. Thames) identified largely consistent responses. The establishment of D. haemobaphes also resulted in some modifications to the functional composition of aquatic communities primarily associated with voltinism and resistance features. Synthesis and applications. Our findings indicate that Dikerogammarus haemobaphes should be considered a significant pressure to riverine communities. These results have implications for biomonitoring, which informs managerial actions as effects may not be detected using a single taxonomic index. Community functional measures are useful in characterising the effects of invasive species and may form a valuable part of the 'toolbox' used for studying biological invasions in rivers.

However, potential disadvantages of sexuals due to their breeding system have received little attention so far. Here, we study the breeding system of five narrowly distributed sexual lineages of Ranunculus notabilis s.l. (R. auricomus complex) and its effects on outcrossing, inbreeding, female fitness, and heterozygosity. We performed selfing and intra- and interlineage crossings by bagging 481 flowers (59 garden individuals) followed by germination experiments. We compared seed set and germination rates, and related them to genetic distance and genome-wide heterozygosity (thousands of RADseq loci). Selfings (2.5%) unveiled a significantly lower seed set compared with intra- (69.0%) and interlineage crossings (69.5%). Seed set of intra- (65%) compared to interpopulation crossings (78%) was significantly lower. In contrast, all treatments showed comparable germination rates (32%-43%). Generalized linear regressions between seed set and genetic distance revealed positive relationships in general and between lineages, and a negative one within lineages. Seed set was the main decisive factor for female fitness. Germination rates were not related to genetic distance at any level, but were positively associated with heterozygosity in interlineage crossings. Experiments confirmed full crossability and predominant outcrossing among sexual R. notabilis s.l. lineages. However, up to 5% (outliers 15%-31%) of seeds were formed by selfing, probably due to semi-self-compatibility in a multi-locus gametophytic SI system. Less seed set in intrapopulation crossings, and higher seed set and germination rates from crossings of genetically more distant and heterozygous lineages (interlineage) indicate negative inbreeding and positive outbreeding effects. In GP scenarios, sexual species with small and/or isolated populations can suffer from decreased female fitness due to their breeding system. This factor, among others, probably limits range expansion of sexuals.",,,,"Hodac, Ladislav/AAP-7284-2021","Hodac, Ladislav/0000-0002-6885-1317; Karbstein, Kevin/0000-0003-1424-6557",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,DEC,2020,10,24,,,,,14435,14450,,10.1002/ece3.7073,,DEC 2020,,,,,WOS:000595900600001,33391726,,,,,

The goal of this study was to understand how weather conditions influence the dispersal pattern of multiple nonmigratory grasshopper species from lower elevation grassland habitats in which they complete their life-cycles to higher elevations that extend beyond their range limits. Using over a decade of weekly spring to late-summer field survey data along an elevational gradient, we explored how abundance and richness of dispersing grasshoppers were influenced by temperature, precipitation, and wind speed and direction. We also examined how changes in population sizes at lower elevations might influence these patterns. We observed that the abundance of dispersing grasshoppers along the gradient declined 4-fold from the foothills to the subalpine and increased with warmer conditions and when wind flow patterns were mild or in the downslope direction. Thirty-eight unique grasshopper species from lowland sites were detected as dispersers across the survey years, and warmer years and weak upslope wind conditions also increased the richness of these grasshoppers. The pattern of grasshoppers along the gradient was not sex biased. The positive effect of temperature on dispersal rates was likely explained by an increase in dispersal propensity rather than by an increase in the density of grasshoppers at low elevation sites. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the dispersal patterns of organisms are influenced by changing climatic conditions themselves and as such, that this context-dependent dispersal response should be considered when modeling and forecasting the ability of species to respond to climate change.",,,,,"Resasco, Julian/0000-0003-1605-3038",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,DEC,2020,10,24,,,,,14411,14422,,10.1002/ece3.7045,,DEC 2020,,,,,WOS:000594889800001,33391724,,,,,

Our goal was to summarize the current status and trends in human-black vulture conflicts (hereafter human-vulture conflicts), review available management strategies, identify knowledge gaps, and provide recommendations to enhance management and understanding of this species and the associated conflicts. We found human-vulture conflicts are increasing in agriculture (livestock), private and public property (both personal and infrastructure-based), and threats to human health and safety. The greatest increases in conflicts were reported in agriculture and private and public property damage. Regarding livestock depredation, good progress has been made toward assessing producer perceptions of the conflicts, including estimates of economic damage and mitigation strategies, but a basic understanding of the underlying mechanism driving the conflict and advancing strategies to mitigate damage is lacking. For damaged property, little information is available regarding economic losses and perceptions of stakeholders who are experiencing the damage, and most of the tools recommended for mitigating this damage have not been rigorously evaluated. Regarding human health and safety, recent research quantifying flight behavior of black vultures has direct implications for reducing aircraft collision risks. However, it is unclear what factors influence roost site selection and the most effective means to leverage the sensory ecology of the species to mitigate risks.

Shrub and tree encroachment, and the expansion of forest birds and the formerly persecuted mammalian ungulates and carnivores, were highlighted as the major consequences of the rural exodus in Italy. In this report, we provide a more integrative view, and show that a rural exodus also explains other ecological phenomena that are usually treated independently. After reviewing the ecological consequences of the rural exodus that has been affecting a large part of Spain during the last six decades, we suggest that this set of ecological consequences also includes the movement of shy-selected predators and large, big game species out of their former ecological refuges, as well as increased frequencies of individuals with bolder-behaviours in recovering populations. We develop a tentative conceptual model linking the increasing approach of wildlife to anthropogenic habitats and human depopulation of rural areas. These links are created by the increasing difficulty to survive and reproduce in recovering, high-predation wild areas, due to mesopredator release and the loss of fear to humans, among other factors. We acknowledge that the recovery of formerly persecuted wildlife in depopulated landscapes has been helped by conservation policies, but we suggest that policies alone cannot explain the observed changes.

A range of conservation actions has been proposed to allow biodiversity to respond to those environmental changes. However, determining the relative effectiveness of these actions has been hampered by incomplete evidence. Empirical studies have provided important insights to inform conservation, but the challenge of considering multiple actions at large spatial and temporal scales is considerable. We adopt an individual-based modelling approach to qualitatively assess the effectiveness of alternative conservation actions in facilitating range expansion and patch occupancy for eight virtual species. We test actions to: (i) improve the quality of existing habitat patches, (ii) increase the permeability of the surrounding matrix, (iii) restore degraded habitat, (iv) create new habitat patches to form stepping-stones or (v) create new habitat to enlarge existing habitat patches. These actions are systematically applied to six real landscapes of the UK, which differ in their degree of habitat fragmentation and availability. Creating new habitat close to existing patches typically provides the strongest benefits for both range expansion and patch occupancy across species and landscapes. However, some landscapes may be so degraded that even under unrealistically high levels of management action, species' performances cannot be rescued.

Although the triangle concept is widely used among fields, to date there has not been an analytical implementation of the model. Current modelling in invasion biology often only considers the effects of one or two factors on the outcomes of species introductions. A mathematical implementation of the triangle model will allow a more comprehensive consideration of the various ecological factors. Here, we provide the first mathematical theorem for an interpretation of the invasion triangle that allows for the consideration of time. This new analytical development of the triangle is flexible, and can be used to model the spatial and temporal population dynamics observed in invasions. We also describe the conditions under which invasion is maintained when factors change with opposing effects. In this interpretation, the lower limits for invasion are explicitly defined and each component can move independently. The complexity of the interactions between factors contributing to invasions is integrated into the single model, such as those suggested by major invasion hypotheses.

The challenge of dealing with introduced populations increases when charismatic species are involved, such as the case of invasive squirrels. In this study, we integrate previous information into a comprehensive description of the invasion process of Callosciurus erythraeus in Argentina, and we synthesise a framework of invasion pathways and associated lag times for introduced squirrel species. One of the main invasion pathways for introduced squirrels involves the trade of pets and ornamental wildlife, i.e. deliberate transportation by humans as vectors using routes of pet/ornamental trade. This was the case of the importation of C. erythraeus into Argentina in 1970 that originated an invasion focus, which firstly spread through squirrels dispersing into nearby habitat (unaided spread). Apart from this local spread, we have recorded a total of 31 translocations within the country of squirrels taken 33 933 km from the source site (aided spread). Most of these translocations-releases occurred close to the invasion foci that functioned as a source of squirrels. Therefore, a key pathway for the invasion of C. erythraeus in Argentina is the illegal and intentional transport of individuals within country boundaries. Time lags can be found throughout the invasion process. We have previously described a lag in population growth and range expansion in the main invasion focus, and also a lag in vector activity (i.e. a lag in the onset of translocations). We now report a lag in the time between the detection by residents of C. erythraeus in a new area and when they report its observation. This time lag shows a decreasing trend, i.e. recent releases are reported sooner, that could respond to a changing lag in the perception of the problem due to communication activities. We propose a general conceptual framework for invasive squirrels that integrates two invasion pathways (A: aided spread that determines the number of invasion foci, and B: unaided spread that determines the size of each invasion focus) and three types of time lags (1: lag in population growth and spread, 2: lag in vector activity, and 3: lag in perception of the problem (human dimension)). Communication and education activities can be a powerful tool to change perceptions and gain support and active engagement of the local community to deal with invasive, charismatic species.

Methods We compared the demographic and genetic variation in 42 wild populations of the Western oviparous subclade B2 of a cold-adapted lizard (Zootoca vivipara louislantzi). These populations can be divided into four ecological units across altitudinal clines in South-west France (rear edge: <100 m, admixture zone: 100-500 m, continuous range: 500-1,300 m and leading edge: >1,300 m above sea level). Results Within the rear edge were found the highest levels of inbreeding, genetic differentiation and evidence of interrupted gene flow compared to central or colonizing areas. Within the leading edge, altitudinal range expansion occurred over the last centuries and populations showed relatively low genetic diversity. These demographic and genetic trends were better explained by inhospitable (warm and dry) climate conditions and forest cover.

J,"Kerr, JT",,,,"Kerr, Jeremy T.",,,Racing against change: understanding dispersal and persistence to improve species' conservation prospects,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,,,,,,,,,,,,"Climate change is contributing to the widespread redistribution, and increasingly the loss, of species. Geographical range shifts among many species were detected rapidly after predictions of the potential importance of climate change were specified 35 years ago: species are shifting their ranges towards the poles and often to higher elevations in mountainous areas. Early tests of these predictions were largely qualitative, though extraordinarily rapid and broadly based, and statistical tests distinguishing between climate change and other global change drivers provided quantitative evidence that climate change had already begun to cause species' geographical ranges to shift. I review two mechanisms enabling this process, namely development of approaches for accounting for dispersal that contributes to range expansion, and identification of factors that alter persistence and lead to range loss. Dispersal in the context of range expansion depends on an array of processes, like population growth rates in novel environments, rates of individual species movements to new locations, and how quickly areas of climatically tolerable habitat shift. These factors can be tied together in well-understood mathematical frameworks or modelled statistically, leading to better prediction of extinction risk as climate changes. Yet, species' increasing exposures to novel climate conditions can exceed their tolerances and raise the likelihood of local extinction and consequent range losses. Such losses are the consequence of processes acting on individuals, driven by factors, such as the growing frequency and severity of extreme weather, that contribute local extinction risks for populations and species. Many mechanisms can govern how species respond to climate change, and rapid progress in global change research creates many opportunities to inform policy and improve conservation outcomes in the early stages of the sixth mass extinction.",,,,,"Kerr, Jeremy/0000-0002-3972-7560",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,NOV 25,2020,287,1939,,,,,,,20202061,10.1098/rspb.2020.2061,,,,,,,WOS:000595765900006,33234075,,,,,

Here, we determine if the realized climatic niche has changed during the expansion and analyse the geographic pattern of spread in Australia. Location: Asia and Australia. Methods: We collated occurrence records, divided the geographic range into three spatio-temporal phases (pre-expansion, early-expansion and late-expansion) and then developed ecological niche models for each phase. To determine whether the realized niche has changed during the range expansion, we performed a principal component analyses and niche overlap analysis. Finally, we calculated the annual rate of range expansion to estimate the speed and pattern of geographic spread. Results: The climatic niche of A. terpsicore differs only slightly in the pre-expansion and late-expansion ranges and was most distinct in the early-expansion range. This species range expanded in Australia at an average rate of similar to 135 km/year (range: 34-359 km/year). Female-biased migration occurred in north-eastern Queensland at the leading edge of the range, the first documentation of this phenomenon in butterflies. Main Conclusions: Acraea terpsicore represents one of the fastest documented geographic range expansions of any species, highlighting how rapidly butterflies can colonize new areas, even where environmental conditions are substantially different to those in their original distribution. However, we found little evidence of climatic niche shift, and only a minor niche shift is apparent in the early-expansion and late-expansion ranges.

Concurrently, the Barents Sea stock of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, one of the most important commercial fish stocks in the world, increased following a large reduction in fishing pressure and expanded north of 80 degrees N. We examined the influence of food availability and temperature on cod expansion using a comprehensive data set on cod stomach fullness stratified by subregions characterized by divergent temperature trends. We then tested whether food availability, as indexed by cod stomach fullness, played a role in cod expansion in subregions that were warming, cooling, or showed no trend. The greatest increase in cod occupancy occurred in three northern subregions with contrasting temperature trends. Cod apparently benefited from initial high food availability in these regions that previously had few large-bodied fish predators. The stomach fullness in the northern subregions declined rapidly after a few years of high cod abundance, suggesting that the arrival of cod caused a top-down effect on the prey base.

This information allows researchers to pinpoint the provenance of invasive plants and to test the importance of genetic admixture in facilitating invasion success. We assessed genetic structuring across the native range of A. auriculiformis, to determine whether genetic admixture contributes to the success of this weed in its introduced range, and test for rapid adaptation to environmental conditions in the invasive lineage. Location Australia, Papua New Guinea, Florida. Taxon Earleaf acacia. Methods We sampled A. auriculiformis from across its entire native distribution (northern Australia, Papua New Guinea) and its invasive range in Florida, and used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to assess population structuring. Results Principal component analysis, based on 9591 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, indicated significant differentiation among samples from Papua New Guinea, the Northern Territory (Australia) and north Queensland (Australia). Florida samples also formed a distinct cluster, with these samples most closely related to samples from the Northern Territory. These results indicate that the Florida A. auriculiformis lineage most likely originates from the Northern Territory, with no evidence that plants were introduced from different parts of the native range. We found evidence of allelic shifts in the Florida population, suggesting rapid adaptation to environmental conditions may contribute the success of the invasive lineage. Main conclusions Two well-known biogeographic barriers-the Carpentaria Gap and Torres Strait-have caused genome-wide divergence among A. auriculiformis plants from north Queensland, Northern Territory and Papua New Guinea. The taxonomic status of these allopatric populations should be further assessed. As the Florida lineage originated in the Northern Territory, the search for potential biological control agents should be focused in this region.

Although L. humile arrived first, and is therefore more numerically abundant, L. neglectus is the more behaviorally dominant of the two. We performed lab trials to determine whether L. humile could use numerical abundance to overcome the behavioral dominance of L. neglectus and whether the ants' behavioral patterns shifted when the species co-occurred. We found that L. neglectus was more aggressive when less abundant, whereas the opposite was true of L. humile. When L. neglectus was outnumbered, it employed aggressive behaviors, such as biting or chemical attacks, more frequently than L. humile; it also utilized a behavioral sequence that included mandible opening and biting. Our results for these species support the hypothesis that species modulate their behavior towards competitors, which facilitates the understanding of how multiple invasive ant species can co-occur in a given area. Moreover, our study shows that the co-occurrence of invasive species could result from the use of two strategies: (1) the Bourgeois strategy, in which aggressiveness changes based on numerical dominance and (2) the dear-enemy strategy, in which aggressiveness is reduced when competitors co-occur. Since these strategies may lead to territory partitioning, we suggest that the behavioral flexibility displayed by both species when they overlap may allow local co-occurrence and increase their likelihood of co-occurrence during their range expansion in Europe, which could have a negative cumulative impact on invaded areas.",,,,"Trigos-Peral, Gema/AAH-3187-2021; Peral, Gema Trigos/ABH-6692-2020; Angulo, Elena/AAF-8524-2020","Trigos-Peral, Gema/0000-0002-8713-5703; Angulo, Elena/0000-0001-5545-4032",,,,,,,,,,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,,,MAR,2021,23,3,,,,,935,953,,10.1007/s10530-020-02412-4,,NOV 2020,,,,,WOS:000591105300001,,,,,,

We sought to address these and related questions in populations resulting from the recent introduction and subsequent rapid range expansion of Onthophagus taurus dung beetles. Specifically, we manipulated both microbial communities and rearing temperature to detect signatures of developmental and life history differentiation in response to the local thermal conditions in two populations derived from the southern most (Florida) and northern most (Michigan) extremes of the exotic Eastern U.S. range of O. taurus. We then sought to determine the contributions, if any, of host-associated microbiota to this differentiation. We found that when reared under common garden conditions individuals from Florida and Michigan populations differed significantly in developmental performance measures and life history traits, consistent with population divergence. At the same time, and contrary to our predictions, we failed to find support for the hypothesis that animals perform better if reared at temperatures that match their location of origin and that performance differences may be mediated by host-associated microbiota. Instead, we found that microbiome swapping across host populations improved developmental performance in both populations, consistent with enemy release dynamics.

However, the evolutionary histories of tree species that have responded to past geological and climate oscillations in central China's mountainous areas remain mostly unknown. In this study, we assessed the evolutionary history of the endangered and relict tree species Dipteronia sinensis in the Qinling Mountains (QM) and adjacent areas in East Asia based on variations in the complete chloroplast genomes (cpDNA) and reduced-genomic scale single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Population structure and phylogenetic analysis based on the cpDNA variations suggested that D. sinensis could be divided into two intraspecific genetic lineages in the eastern and western sides of the QM (EQM and WQM, respectively) in East Asia. Molecular dating suggested that the intraspecific divergence of D. sinensis occurred approximately 39.2 million years ago during the later Paleogene. It was significantly correlated with the orogeny of the QM, where the formation of this significant geographic barrier in the region may have led to the divergence of independent lineages. Bayesian clustering and demographic analysis showed that intraspecific gene flow was restricted between the EQM and WQM lineages. Isolation-with-migration analysis indicated that the two genetic lineages experienced significant demographic expansions after the Pleistocene ice ages. However, the genetic admixture was determined in some populations between the two lineages by the large scale of SNP variations due to DNA incompatibility, the large significant population size, and rapid gene flow of nuclear DNA markers. Our results suggest that two different conservation and management units should be constructed for D. sinensis in the EQM and WQM areas.

Location Global. Time period Late Oligocene to the present day. Major taxa studied The Corvides (c. 790 species). Methods We obtained 10 linear measurements of external morphology for 782 species of corvoid passerines. Using these measurements as a proxy for species ecology, we assessed the positioning of corvoid families in eco-morphological trait space and how these factors were associated with their species richness and rates of lineage diversification. Subsequently, we compared these same characteristics (species richness, morphological positioning and rates of lineage diversification) between families that are currently endemic to the Australasian ancestral area of the Corvides with those that have dispersed and diversified throughout other continental and insular landmasses. Results Families with low species richness and rates of diversification tend to occupy the most peripheral positions in eco-morphological trait space, with almost all of these groups being endemic to Australasia. The peripheral eco-morphological positioning of the Australasian groupings is generally greater than expected upon accounting for differences in phylogenetic isolation and heterogeneity in rates of trait evolution, implying that species-poor corvoid families repeatedly evolved towards marginal areas of morphospace.

We collected seeds from two field sites where the two dandelion species occurred nearby. Plants were grown alone, with kin (plants from the same maternal genotype) or strangers (plants from different populations) of the same species, or with different species in a growth chamber, and the performance at the early developmental stage between species and treatments was compared. The invasive dandelions outcompeted the native dandelions when competing against each other, although no difference between species was detected without competition or with intraspecific competition. Populations of native species responded to interspecific competition differently. The effect of kinship on plant performance differed between the tested populations in both species. A population produced more biomass than the other populations when grown with a stranger, and this trend was manifested more in native species. Our results support the hypothesis that invasive plants have better competitive ability than native plants, which potentially contributes to the establishment and the range expansion of T. officinale in the introduced range.

It is present across the continental part of Croatia, with first records from the Mura-Drava river basin in 2008 and from the karstic Korana River in 2011. In both rivers, P. leniusculus presents an imminent ducat to indigenous crayfish species (ICS). The aim of the study was to explore the range expansion of P. leniusculus 10 years after its first record in Croatia. Based on the data collected via an extensive literature search and our own fieldwork performed in 2018, we here demonstrated that P. leniusculus is the most successful non-indigenous crayfish species (NICS) in Croatia, with the invasion range covering the largest extent of Croatia compared to other NICS. Its dispersal rates in the rivers of the continental part of Croatia have remained among the highest in Europe. In the Drava River, recorded dispersal rate (21.3 km/yr) corresponded to the predictions made by the earlier study that estimated P. leniusculus dispersal over 10 years. However, due to the low number of caught individuals along the 128 km of the Drava River course, dispersal rates as well as invasion pathways (natural vs. human-mediated) need to be further explored. The predicted encounter of P. leniusculus with the invasive Faxonius limosus was not observed. In the Korana River, we observed a continued expansion of P. leniusculus invasion range in both upstream and downstream direction. Dispersal rates were higher in the upstream direction, potentially due to differences in competitive pressure by the native crayfish, Pontastacus leptodactylus, which abundances were 6 tunes higher at the downstream invasion front. In both rivers, a displacement of the native P. leptodactylus has been observed. Even though P. leptodactylus has been considered to be the most robust ICS, that successfully expands its range in water bodies of Croatia and Europe, it is also the species the most adversely affected by the range expansion of the P. leniusculus in the continental part of Croatia. Thus, the status of P. leptodactylus in Croatia should be monitored and re-examined.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2242-1300,,,,,NOV,2020,9,4,,,,,793,807,,10.3391/bir.2020.9.4.13,,,,,,,WOS:000592519700013,,,,,,

Previous studies have investigated the introduction sources for P. lophantha subsp. lophantha overseas, but here, we expand on the knowledge of genetic patterns in its native and naturalized range in Australia. Genetic patterns were examined using nine nuclear microsatellite loci and three chloroplast DNA markers. The native populations exhibited phylogeographic patterns, including north-south differentiation, and a genetic signal related to temperature gradients. Naturalized Australian populations displayed lower overall genetic variation and no phylogeographic patterns. Several naturalized populations separated by large distances (350-650 km) shared multi-locus genotypes, supporting the notion of a shared source of germplasm and possible inbreeding due to human-mediated introductions from a limited number of individuals and/or source populations within the native range. We advocate that management strategies are tailored to the distinct conservation aims underpinning conservation in native or naturalized populations.

Applications such as Close-Kin Mark-Recapture demand large amounts of data to estimate population size and structure, and their full potential can only be realised through ongoing improvements in genotyping strategies. Here we introduce DArTcap, a cost-efficient method that combines DArTseq and sequence capture, and illustrate its use in a high resolution population analysis of Glyphis garricki, a rare, poorly known and threatened euryhaline shark. Clustering analyses and spatial distribution of kin pairs from four different regions across northern Australia and one in Papua New Guinea, representing its entire known range, revealed that each region hosts at least one distinct population. Further structuring is likely within Van Diemen Gulf, the region that included the most rivers sampled, suggesting additional population structuring would be found if other rivers were sampled. Coalescent analyses and spatially explicit modelling suggest that G. garricki experienced a recent range expansion during the opening of the Gulf of Carpentaria following the conclusion of the Last Glacial Maximum. The low migration rates between neighbouring populations of a species that is found only in restricted coastal and riverine habitats show the importance of managing each population separately, including careful monitoring of local and remote anthropogenic activities that may affect their environments.

The aim of this study was to test whether the so-called three-step landforms of China, together with the East China Sea (ECS), have acted to shape specific phylogeographical patterns and affected the biogeographical history of the species belonging to the East Asian Flora. Location China and Japan. Taxon Kerria japonica (L.) DC. Methods Three chloroplast DNA regions and 15 nuclear microsatellite (nSSR) loci were sequenced and genotyped in 576/450 individuals of K. japonica. Phylogeographical analyses were performed to assess the genetic structure, historical gene flow and demographical history of these individuals, and climatic factors were examined to determine their effects on phylogeographical breaks. Furthermore, time-calibrated phylogenetic trees and ancestral range reconstruction were used to infer the biogeographical history of K. japonica. Potential habitats at present and during the last glacial maximum (LGM) were identified using ecological niche modelling. Results Distinct phylogeographical breaks were found across the ECS and along the boundary of the three-step landforms of China. Low historical gene flow and significant climatic differences were detected in each pair of adjacent regions. The results of molecular dating and ancestral range reconstruction indicated that K. japonica originated in North America during the mid-Miocene (14.76 Ma), and intra-specific diversification began in the late Miocene (7.78 Ma). Compared to the relatively stable distribution range of Chinese populations, Japanese populations experienced range expansion after the LGM in response to Quaternary climate change. Main conclusions Kerria japonica has a complex biogeographical history, with a mid-Miocene origin in North America and subsequent migration into East Asia via the Bering land bridge. The onset of intra-specific diversification was probably associated with Asian monsoon intensifications, while exposure to the ECS floor facilitated the formation of the Japanese lineage in the late Miocene. The spatiotemporal population differentiation on the Chinese mainland demonstrates the significant role of biogeographical divides delineated by the three-step landforms of China and provides clues to understand the floristic regionalization and evolutionary history of plant diversity in East Asia, especially with respect to the Hengduan Mountains, Central China and East China.",,,,"Dong, Luo/AAG-4377-2021","Sun, Hang/0000-0001-5127-4579; Luo, Dong/0000-0002-6865-5965",,,,,,,,,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,,,FEB,2021,48,2,,,,,372,385,,10.1111/jbi.14002,,NOV 2020,,,,,WOS:000583189300001,,,,,,

Failure to adopt the scale-dependent framework in species habitat relationships may lead to biased inferences. Multi-scale species distribution models (SDMs) can thus improve the predictive ability as compared to single-scale approaches. This study outlines the importance of multi-scale modeling in assessing the species habitat relationships and may provide a methodological framework using a robust algorithm to model and predict habitat suitability maps (HSMs) for similar multi-species and multi-scale studies. Results We used a supervised machine learning algorithm, random forest (RF), to assess the habitat relationships of Asiatic wildcat (Felis lybica ornata), jungle cat (Felis chaus), Indian fox (Vulpes bengalensis), and golden-jackal (Canis aureus) at ten spatial scales (500-5000 m) in human-dominated landscapes. We calculated out-of-bag (OOB) error rates of each predictor variable across ten scales to select the most influential spatial scale variables. The scale optimization (OOB rates) indicated that model performance was associated with variables at multiple spatial scales. The species occurrence tended to be related strongest to predictor variables at broader scales (5000 m). Multivariate RF models indicated landscape composition to be strong predictors of the Asiatic wildcat, jungle cat, and Indian fox occurrences. At the same time, topographic and climatic variables were the most important predictors determining the golden jackal distribution. Our models predicted range expansion in all four species under future climatic scenarios. Conclusions Our results highlight the importance of using multiscale distribution models when predicting the distribution and species habitat relationships. The wide adaptability of meso-carnivores allows them to persist in human-dominated regions and may even thrive in disturbed habitats. These meso-carnivores are among the few species that may benefit from climate change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2192-1709,,,,OCT 30,2020,9,1,,,,,,,60,10.1186/s13717-020-00265-2,,,,,,,WOS:000589579600001,,,,,,

It remains unknown how this reemergence occurred, specifically if local populations have been overlooked at low densities or if the species has successfully spread across the highly fragmented anthropogenic landscape. In the central German Rhon Mountains, for instance, wildcats were believed to be extinct during most of the twentieth century, however, the species was recently detected and subsequent genetic monitoring found the presence of a sizeable population. In this study, we used microsatellite and SNP genotypes from 146 wildcat individuals from 2008 to 2017 across a similar to 15,000 km(2) area in the central German low mountain region to understand the population re-establishment of wildcats in the region. Bayesian clustering and subsequent analyses revealed that animals in the Rhon Mountains appear to be a mix from the two adjacent populations in the North and South of the area, suggesting a recent range expansion from two different directions. Both populations meet in the Rhon Biosphere Reserve, leading to an admixture of the northern, autochthonous, and the southern reintroduced wildcat population. While we cannot completely exclude the possibility of undetected population persistence, the high genetic homogeneity in the central German wildcat population and the lack of any signatures of past population decline in the Rhon favor a scenario of natural expansion. Our findings thus suggest that wildcats are well capable of rapid range expansion across richly structured landscape mosaics consisting of open land, settlements, and forest patches and document the potential of massive non-invasive genetic sampling when aiming to reconstruct the complex population and range dynamics of wildlife.",,,,,"Mueller, Sarah/0000-0002-6294-0159",,,,,,,,,,,,1612-4642,1439-0574,,,,OCT 29,2020,66,6,,,,,,,94,10.1007/s10344-020-01433-7,,,,,,,WOS:000586130900001,,,,,,

Furthermore, soil biota can foster exotic spread in the absence of negative soil pathogen-plant interactions or because of increased positive soil biota-plant feedbacks in the exotic range. Little is known, however, about the evolutionary dimension of plant-soil biota interactions when comparing native and introduced ranges. To assess the role of soil microbes for rapid evolution in plant invasion, we subjected Verbascum thapsus, a species native to Europe, to a reciprocal transplant experiment with soil and seed material originating from Germany (native) and New Zealand (exotic). Soil samples were treated with biocides to distinguish between effects of soil fungi and bacteria. Seedlings from each of five native and exotic populations were transplanted into soil biota communities originating from all populations and subjected to treatments of soil biota reduction: application of (a) fungicide, (b) biocide, (c) a combination of the two, and (d) control. For most of the investigated traits, native populations showed higher performance than exotic populations; there was no effect of soil biota origin. However, plants developed longer leaves and larger rosettes when treated with their respective home soil communities, indicating that native and exotic plant populations differed in their interaction with soil biota origin. The absence of fungi and bacteria resulted in a higher specific root length, suggesting that V. thapsus may compensate the absence of mutualistic microbes by increasing its root-soil surface contact. Synthesis. Introduced plants can evolve adaptations to soil biota in their new distribution range. This demonstrates the importance of biogeographic differences in plant-soil biota relationships and suggests that future studies addressing evolutionary divergence should account for differential effects of soil biota from the home and exotic range on native and exotic populations of successful plant invaders.",,,,"Gutknecht, Jessica/AAI-3682-2021; Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013","Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356; Erfmeier, Alexandra/0000-0002-1002-9216",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,DEC,2020,10,23,,,,,13057,13070,,10.1002/ece3.6894,,OCT 2020,,,,,WOS:000585939000001,33304516,,,,,

These new selection pressures can be accommodated by different mechanisms that act on different levels and across different time scales: (1) By changing transcriptomic profiles, species can react by plasticity within individual physiological limitations. (2) Invasive populations can adapt by fixing beneficial genetic variants in response to the newly encountered selection pressures. Here, we compare the genomic and transcriptomic landscapes of two independent invasions of the Pacific Oyster (Crassostrea gigas) into the North Sea. In detail, we combine ddRAD sequencing on the genomic level with RNAseq on the transcriptomic level to reveal outlier loci (SNPs) indicative of adaptation, as well as transcriptomic profiles from a translocation experiment to show immediate physiological reactions between two populations characterizing the two independent invasions. Generally, we found low physical congruence between differentially regulated genes and outlier loci, indicating that different genes are involved on the different time scales. Functionally matching outlier loci and differentially expressed genes were however found for spliceosomal modification of mRNA and particularly for transposon activation, indicating that these variation creating processes might be connected across eco-physiological and evolutionary time scales. By contrasting and identifying functional congruence between population outlier loci and population specific transcriptomic profiles, we can thus reveal a glimpse at the traits and processes characterizing specific mechanisms involved in successful invasions.",,,,"Wegner, K.

Three of the species are cyclically parthenogenetic [Ad. nordmannianae (Eckstein), Ad. prelli (Grossmann), and Ad. merkeri (Eichhorn)] and three are obligately asexual [Ad. piceae, Ad. schneideri (Borner), and Ad. nebrodensis (Binazzi & Covassi)]. Some species are high-impact pests of fir (Abies) trees, so stable species names are needed to communicate effectively about management. Therefore, to refine species delimitation, guided by a reconstruction of their biogeographic history, we genotyped adelgids from Europe, North America, and the Caucasus Mountains region with 19 microsatellite loci, sequenced the COI DNA barcoding region, and compared morphology. Discriminant analysis of principal components of microsatellite genotypes revealed four distinct genetic clusters. Two clusters were morphologically consistent with Ad. nordmannianae. One of these clusters consisted of samples from the Caucasus Mountains and northern Turkey, and the other included samples from this region as well as from Europe and North America, where Ad. nordmannianae is invasive. A third cluster was morphologically consistent with Ad. piceae, and included individuals from Europe, where it is native, and North America, where it is invasive. In North America, the majority of Ad. piceae individuals were assigned to two geographically widespread clones, suggesting multiple introductions. The fourth cluster included individuals morphologically consistent with Ad. prelli or Ad. merkeri. However, based on genetic assignments, hybrid simulations, and approximate Bayesian computation, we find it likely that these are contemporary hybrids between Ad. nordmannianae and Ad. piceae that arose independently in Europe and North America, so we propose that Ad. prelli and Ad. merkeri are invalid. Finally, we synonymise Ad. schneideri (syn.n.) with Ad. nordmannianae and designate Ad. nebrodensis as subspecies Ad. piceae nebrodensis (stat.n.). Our revised taxonomy therefore recognises two species: Ad. nordmannianae and Ad. piceae, which we estimate to have diverged recently, during one of the last two interglacial periods.

Thirty-one percent of Canada's bird species listed for recovery under the Canadian Species at Risk Act (SARA) are at the periphery of their range. A listing of endangered under SARA requires identification of critical habitat for the species. With anticipated climate change, recovery of species requires a more proactive intervention than relying on historical occurrence to locate suitable habitat. We synthesized 19 years of Sage Thrasher occurrence and related habitat data across the species' northern range in British Columbia (BC) and Washington (WA) to define critical habitat characteristics. We found Sage Thrashers selected less leaf litter and less grass cover in flat or low-slope regions farther from anthropogenic or natural habitat breaks; habitat sensitive to the expected climate change impacts of fire, changes in precipitation, and invasive species establishment. By augmenting the BC data collected in the species' peripheral range with data from their core distribution in WA, we identified key habitat elements of an otherwise data-poor species that do not breed in sufficient numbers in Canada to reliably characterize their habitat. These methods improve the identification of critical habitat for peripheral species like Sage Thrashers in preparation for climate-induced range expansion northward.

These trends of population growth in Gentoo Penguins are in stark contrast to those of Adelie and Chinstrap Penguins, which have experienced considerable population declines along the WAP attributed to environmental changes. The recent discovery of previously unknown Gentoo Penguin colonies along the WAP and evidence for southern range expansion since the last global assessment in 2013 motivates this review of the abundance and distribution of this species. We compiled and collated all available recent data for every known Gentoo Penguin colony in the world and report on previously unknown Gentoo Penguin colonies along the Northwestern section of the WAP.

Considering the current trend of increasing seawater temperature, warm-water species are expected to expand their geographic distribution ranges. Ecological niche modeling (ENM) is an important tool to help describe likely changes in geographic distribution patterns of a species in different climatic scenarios. To evaluate changes in the distribution of Octopus insularis over time, the maximum entropy approach was used, which estimated a suitable climatic niche for Octopus under 5 scenarios of global climate change. Four environmental variables were chosen to model the suitable climatic niche of O. insularis in the present, past, and future scenarios. The ENM in different climatic scenarios showed good validation and pointed out an increase of the suitable niche for O. insularis settlement, from the Last Glacial Maximum (21 kya) up to future scenarios. In the future projections, suitable niche space will potentially increase in the tropical Atlantic compared to the current distribution. Modeling pointed out the possibility of expansion from the current range of the species to the temperate northern Atlantic, temperate South America, and temperate South Africa. This may cause potential threats, such as possible extinction of endemic species, habitat displacement of native octopuses, and reorganizations in the trophic chain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,OCT 15,2020,652,,,,,,111,121,,10.3354/meps13486,,,,,,,WOS:000621232000008,,,,,,

The efficacy of management planning and decision making to limit such invasions can be improved by understanding how interventions will impact the population dynamics of recently introduced species. To do so, here we expand on a typological framework that enables the classification of populations over time into 10 categories of commonness, and apply it to a spatially discrete metapopulation with heterogeneous abundance across spatial units (patches). We use this framework to assess the effect of cross-boundary management on the capacity of a metapopulation with different demographic and dispersal characteristics, including time lags in population growth, to become common. We demonstrate this framework by simulating a simple theoretical metapopulation model capable of exploring a range of environments, species characteristics, and management actions. Management can vary in the efficacy of propagule interception between patches, and in the synchronisation of the implementation of these measures across patches (i.e. if management is implemented simultaneously across patches). Simulations show that poor interception efficacy that only modestly reduces the number of propagules entering a given spatial unit cannot be compensated for by strong management synchronisation between spatial units. Management synchronisation will nonetheless result in a reduction in rates of spread once a critical threshold of interception efficacy has been met. Finally, time lags in population growth that may result in delayed spread are an important aspect to be considered in management as they can amplify the efficacy of management. Our results demonstrate how a typological framework of categories of commonness can be used to provide practical insights for the management of biological invasions.",,,,"Latombe, Guillaume/AAI-1012-2021","Latombe, Guillaume/0000-0002-8589-8387",,,,,,,,,,,,1619-0033,1314-2488,,,,OCT 15,2020,,62,,,,,241,267,,10.3897/neobiota.62.52708,,,,,,,WOS:000582928700011,,,,,,

For black mangrove (Avicennia germinans), fewer severe freeze events in a warming climate facilitate poleward range expansion into temperate coastal salt marshes, however propagules that disperse into marshes encounter biotic interactions (e.g., predation) that affect their survival and subsequent forest development. To better understand the relative roles of climate, predation, and propagule dispersal in shaping A. germinans range expansion, we developed a stage-based population model that tested forest stand establishment and survival under differing scenarios of freeze regime, predation pressure, and propagule dispersal. Predation parameters were developed from a field experiment that tested propagule density-predation intensity relationships for purple marsh crab (Sesarma reticulatum), which showed proportional propagule consumption decreased with increased propagule density. Model outcomes demonstrated all measures of mangrove stand development and regeneration decreased with increased freeze and predation intensities, modulated by propagule dispersal density and frequency. Regenerating stands were more likely to recover from freezes under a reduced freeze regime compared to a historical freeze regime, but moderate and high predation intensities hindered stand development and recovery across freeze regimes. Maintaining a regenerating stand generally required recurring dispersal events. While several studies have investigated the individual effects of freezes, predation pressure, and dispersal on mangrove ranges, our model is the first effort of which we are aware that quantifies the combined effects of all three controls. The model can thus serve as a tool for understanding patterns of A. germinans range expansion in the Big Bend and other regions under future warming.",,,,,"Langston, Amy/0000-0002-2402-8898; Kaplan, David/0000-0002-0103-0928",,,,,,,,,,,,0304-3800,1872-7026,,,,OCT 15,2020,434,,,,,,,,109245,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.109245,,,,,,,WOS:000570249700004,,,,,,

Relatively high morphological differentiation was apparent between pureB. tyberinusand hybrid forms, whilst differences were less apparent between pureB. plebejusand their hybrid forms.

Toads from recently invaded areas in western Australia exhibited cutaneous resistance to water loss similar to the native-range populations, possibly because toads are restricted to moist sites within this highly arid landscape.

Evidence for this hypothesis is mixed in eastern North American species, and there is increasing support for colonization from middle latitudes. We studied genome-wide patterns of variation in RADseq loci to test hypotheses concerning range expansion in a North American forest herb (Campanula americana). First, spatial patterns of genetic differentiation were determined. Then phylogenetic relationships and divergence times were estimated. Spatial signatures of genetic drift were also studied to identify the directionality of recent range expansion and its geographical origins. Finally, spatially explicit scenarios for the spread of plants across the landscape were compared, using variation in the population mutation parameter and Tajima'sD. We found strong longitudinal subdivision, with populations clustering into groups west and east of the Mississippi River. While the southeastern region was probably part of a diverse Pleistocene refugium, there is little evidence that range expansion involved founders from these southern locales. Instead, declines in genetic diversity and the loss of rare alleles support a westward colonization wave from a middle latitude refugium near the southern Appalachian Mountains, with subsequent expansion from a Pleistocene staging ground in the Mississippi River Valley (0.51-1.27 million years ago). These analyses implicate stepping stone colonization from middle latitudes as an important mechanism of species range expansion in eastern North America.

We conducted a globally distributed field study of 13 alpine sites across four continents undergoing woody plant encroachment and sampled soils from both woody encroached and nearby herbaceous plant community types. We found that woody plant encroachment influenced soil microbial richness and community composition across sites based on multiple factors including woody plant traits, site level climate, and abiotic soil conditions. In particular, root symbiont type was a key determinant of belowground effects, as Nitrogen-fixing woody plants had higher soil fungal richness, while Ecto/Ericoid mycorrhizal species had higher soil bacterial richness and symbiont types had distinct soil microbial community composition. Woody plant leaf traits indirectly influenced soil microbes through their impact on soil abiotic conditions, primarily soil pH and C:N ratios. Finally, site-level climate affected the overall magnitude and direction of woody plant influence, as soil fungal and bacterial richness were either higher or lower in woody encroached versus herbaceous soils depending on mean annual temperature and precipitation. All together, these results document global impacts of woody plant encroachment on soil microbial communities, but highlight that multiple biotic and abiotic pathways must be considered to scale up globally from site- and species-level patterns.

The integration of citizen scientists into ecological research is transforming how, where, and when data are collected, and expanding the potential scales of ecological studies. Citizen-science projects can provide numerous benefits for participants while educating and connecting professionals with lay audiences, potentially increasing the acceptance of conservation and management actions. However, for all the benefits, collection of citizen-science data is often biased towards areas that are easily accessible (e.g. developments and roadways), and thus data are usually affected by issues typical of opportunistic surveys (e.g. uneven sampling effort). These areas are usually illuminated by artificial light at night (ALAN), a dynamic sensory stimulus that alters the perceptual world for both humans and wildlife. 2. Our goal was to test whether satellite-based measures of ALAN could improve our understanding of the detection process of citizen-scientist-reported sightings of a large mammal. 3. We collected observations of American black bears Ursus americanus (n = 1,315) outside their primary range in Minnesota, USA, as part of a study to gauge population expansion. Participants from the public provided sighting locations of bears on a website. We used an occupancy modelling framework to determine how well ALAN accounted for observer metrics compared to other commonly used metrics (e.g. housing density). 4. Citizen scientists reported 17% of bear sightings were under artificially lit conditions and monthly ALAN estimates did the best job accounting for spatial bias in detection of all observations, based on AIC values and effect sizes ((beta) over cap = 0.81, 0.71-0.90 95% CI). Bear detection increased with elevated illuminance; relative abundance was positively associated with natural cover, proximity to primary bear range and lower road density. Although the highest counts of bear sightings occurred in the highly illuminated suburbs of the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan region, we estimated substantially higher bear abundance in another region with plentiful natural cover and low ALAN (up to similar to 375% increased predicted relative abundance) where observations were sparse. 5.

Although the species is wide-spread all over Europe, no reproduction via seeds has ever been observed. Instead dispersal of vegetative leaf-axillary bulbs assures effective propagation. In our study we analyzed different life stages and factors affecting sexual reproduction and seek for unravelling the evolutionary origin of this polyploid species. We combined studies on pollen quality and fertility, pollen-stigma interactions, growth performance, and reproductive success with common garden experiments, controlled pollination and genotyping analysis (AFLPs). We also tested the interplay of resource allocation either into developing fruits and seeds or into reproductive organs generated by vegetative means. Cytogenetic analyses were conducted addressing variation in chromosome numbers and ploidy level. Phylogenetic relationships among possible parental lineages of Eurasian Cardamine species were reconstructed based on whole plastome sequences and the entire nuclear encoded rDNA cistron. We have shown herein that sexual reproduction of Cardamine bulbifera is hindered at various stages of reproductive development. We did not find any complete interruption of reproductive development except final embryo arrest. We detected low pollen germination rates and slow pollen tube growth. Less than 25 % of flowers matured into siliques with most often low-quality seeds; only 2% of those seeds developed towards early stages of germination but arrested before primary root formation. Results are independent from genotypes or vegetative propagation. Phylogenetic data demonstrate close relationships to C. quinquefolia and C. abchasica, but don't indicate a hybrid origin involving distant species from other lineages.

The resultant decrease in fitness is known as expansion load. An Allee effect is known to reduce the loss of genetic diversity of expanding populations, by changing the nature of the expansion from pulledto pushed. We study the impact of an Allee effect on the formation of an expansion load with a new model, in which individuals have the genetic structure of a Muller's ratchet. A key feature of Muller's ratchet is that the population fatally accumulates deleterious mutations due to the stochastic loss of the fittest individuals, an event called a click of the ratchet. We observe fast clicks of the ratchet at the colonization front owing to small population size, followed by a slow fitness recovery due to migration of fit individuals from the bulk of the population, leading to a transient expansion load. For large population size, we are able to derive quantitative features of the expansion wave, such as the wave speed and the frequency of individuals carrying a given number of mutations. Using simulations, we show that the presence of an Allee effect reduces the rate at which clicks occur at the front, and thus reduces the expansion load. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, invasive species occurrence datasets often have spatial biases that may violate key SDM assumptions. In this study, we examined alternative methods of spatial bias correction and multiple methods for model evaluation for seven invasive plant species. Location North America. Taxon Common Tansy (Tanacetum vulgare), Wild Parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), Leafy Spurge (Euphorbia virgata), Common Teasel (Dipsacus fullonum), Brown Knapweed (Centaurea jacea), Black Swallowwort (Vincetoxicum nigrum) and Dalmatian Toadflax (Linaria dalmatica). Methods We employed bias-correction measures for both occurrence sampling and background sampling inputs in a factorial design for Maxent resulting in six potential models for each species. We evaluated our models for complexity, model fit and using commonly employed evaluation metrics: AUC, partial AUC, the continuous Boyce index and sensitivity. We then developed a structured process for model selection. Results Models developed without occurrence or background bias correction often were overly complex and did not transfer well to expanding range fronts. Conversely, models that employed occurrence and/or background bias-correction measures were less complex, had better AICc scores and had greater projection into incipient areas. These simpler models were also more likely to be selected when evaluated using a process that integrated multiple evaluation metrics. We found that invasion history (e.g. established versus incipient) was associated with the effectiveness of spatial bias correction techniques. Main Conclusions While challenges exist in building climate-based correlative species distribution models for invasive species, we found that methods relying on maximizing AUC performed poorly for invasive species. We advocate for the use of multiple and diverse metrics for model evaluation. Users of species distribution models need to incorporate explicit consideration of model discrimination, model fit and model complexity into their decision-making processes if they are to build biologically realistic models.",,,,,"Briscoe Runquist, Ryan/0000-0001-7160-9110",,,,,,,,,,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,,,DEC,2020,26,12,,,,,1767,1779,,10.1111/ddi.13161,,OCT 2020,,,,,WOS:000573963200001,,,,,,

The widespread cattailsTypha latifoliaandT. angustifoliaseldom hybridize in some parts of their range, but in other areas produce the dominant hybridT. x glauca. We used a combination of field and greenhouse experiments to investigate whyT. x glaucahas invaded wetlands in the Laurentian Great Lakes region of southern Ontario, Canada, but is much less common in the coastal wetlands of Nova Scotia (NS) in eastern Canada. One potentially important environmental difference between these two regions is salinity. We therefore tested three hypotheses: (1)T. latifoliaandT. angustifoliain NS are genetically incompatible; (2) the germination or growth ofT. x glaucais reduced by salinity; and (3)T. latifolia,a main competitor ofT. x glauca, is locally adapted to saline conditions in NS.

Yet organisms live in multifaceted environments that are dynamic and ever changing, making it difficult to understand how complex adaptations evolve. This problem is particularly apparent in the evolution of adaptive maternal effects, which are often assumed to require reliable and discrete cues that predict conditions in the offspring environment. One resolution to this problem is if adaptive maternal effects evolve through preexisting, generalized maternal pathways that respond to many cues and also influence offspring development. Here, we assess whether an adaptive maternal effect in western bluebirds is influenced by maternal stress pathways across multiple challenging environments. Combining 18 years of hormone sampling across diverse environmental contexts with an experimental manipulation of the competitive environment, we show that multiple environmental factors influenced maternal corticosterone levels, which, in turn, influenced a maternal effect on aggression of sons in adulthood. Together, these results support the idea that multiple stressors can induce a known maternal effect in this system. More generally, they suggest that activation of general pathways, such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, may simplify and facilitate the evolution of adaptive maternal effects by integrating variable environmental conditions into preexisting maternal physiological systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0147,1537-5323,,,,OCT 1,2020,196,4,,,,,487,500,,10.1086/710210,,OCT 2020,,,,,WOS:000567822600001,32970461,,,,,

Despite its widespread occurrence and its commercial interest in the tropical Indo-West Pacific (IWP), this subfamily has traditionally been considered a taxonomically difficult group. Based on 268 samples collected from all 15 known large-eye seabream species throughout their distribution ranges, we investigated the taxonomic diversity and phylogenetic relationships in the subfamily. From the results of multiple analyses on four gene markers, we confirmed the monophyly of all four genera in the subfamily (Gnathodentex, Gymnocranius, Monotaxis and Wattsia). We confirmed the occurrence of two species in the genus Monotaxis. We reported 15 delimited species within the most speciose genus Gymnocranius, four of which are potentially new species. The time-calibrated phylogenetic reconstruction enabled us to clarify the evolutionary history of the large-eye seabreams and to infer past patterns of species distribution. The most recent common ancestor to the Monotaxinae likely occurred in the central IWP ca. 32 million years ago. A burst of species diversification likely took place during the Mid-to Late Miocene, coinciding with tectonic change in the central IWP region. This gave rise to most extant lineages in Gymnocranius. The observed geographic distribution patterns in the subfamily most likely point to the central IWP as the area of origin and diversification.

Asymmetric gene flow between larger core populations and smaller edge populations can swamp local adaptation at the range edge and inhibit further range expansion. However, empirical tests of this theory are exceedingly rare. We tested the hypothesis that asymmetric gene flow can constrain local adaptation and thereby species' range limits in an endemic US salamander (Ambystoma barbouri) by determining if gene flow is asymmetric between the core and peripheries of the species' geographic distribution and testing whether local adaptation is swamped at range edges with a reciprocal transplant experiment. Using putatively neutral loci from populations across three core-to-edge transects that covered nearly the entire species' geographic range, we found evidence for asymmetric, core-to-edge gene flow along western and northern transects, but not along a southern transect. Subsequently, the reciprocal transplant experiment suggested that northern and western edge populations are locally adapted despite experiencing asymmetric gene flow, yet have lower fitness in their respective home regions than those of centre population. Conversely, southern populations exhibit low deme quality, experiencing high mortality regardless of where they were reared, probably due to harsher edge habitat conditions. Consequently, we provide rare species-wide evidence that local adaptation can occur despite asymmetric gene flow, though migration from the core may prohibit range expansion by reducing fitness in edge populations.

We examine how these range shifts have affected the genetic diversity of a montane butterfly species and whether the genetic diversity in the extant populations is threatened by future climate change. Location Europe. Taxon Erebia epiphronLepidoptera: Nymphalidae. Methods We analyzed mtDNA to map current genetic diversity and differentiation ofE. epiphronacross Europe to identify population refugia and postglacial range shifts. We used species distribution modeling (SDM) to hindcast distributions over the last 21,000 years to identify source locations of extant populations and to project distributions into the future (2070) to predict potential losses in genetic diversity. Results We found substantial genetic diversity unique to specific regions within Europe (total number of haplotypes = 31, number of unique haplotypes = 27,H-d = 0.9). Genetic data and SDM hindcasting suggest long-term separation and survival of discrete populations. Particularly, high rates of unique diversity in postglacially colonized sites in England (H-d = 0.64) suggest this population was colonized from a now extinct cryptic refugium. Under future climate change, SDMs predict loss of climate suitability forE. epiphron, particularly at lower elevations (<1,000 meters above sea level) equating to 1 to 12 unique haplotypes being at risk under climate scenarios projecting 1 degrees C and 2-3 degrees C increases respectfully in global temperature by 2070. Main conclusions Our results suggest that historical range expansion and retraction processes by a cold-adapted mountain species caused diversification between populations, resulting in unique genetic diversity which may be at risk if distributions of cold-adapted species shrink in future.

Despite a number of examples of hybridization occurring during biological invasions, the resulting spatial patterns of genomic introgression remain poorly understood. Preliminary simulation studies have suggested a heterogeneous spatial level of introgression for invasive taxa after range expansion. We investigated in detail the robustness of this pattern and its persistence over time for both invasive and local organisms. Using spatially explicit simulations, we explored the spatial distribution of introgression across the area of colonization of an invasive taxon hybridizing with a local taxon. The general pattern for neutral loci supported by our results is an increasing introgression of local genes into the invasive taxon with the increase in the distance from the source of the invasion and a decreasing introgression of invasive genes into the local taxon. However, we also show there is some variation in this general trend depending on the scenario investigated. Spatial heterogeneity of introgression within a given taxon is thus an expected neutral pattern in structured populations after a biological invasion with a low to moderate amount of hybridization. We further show that this pattern is consistent with published empirical observations. Using additional simulations, we argue that the spatial pattern of Neanderthal introgression in modern humans, which has been documented to be higher in Asia than in Europe, can be explained by a model of hybridization with Neanderthals in Eurasia during the range expansion of modern humans from Africa. Our results support the view that weak hybridization during range expansion may explain spatially heterogeneous introgression patterns without the need to invoke selection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-701X,,,,,SEP 29,2020,8,,,,,,,,569620,10.3389/fevo.2020.569620,,,,,,,WOS:000578632700001,,,,,,

In our study, we used baited camera traps to quantify the structure of the winter scavenger community in central Scandinavia across a forest-alpine continuum and assess how climatic conditions affected spatial patterns of species occurrences at baits. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that the main habitat type (forest or alpine tundra) and snow depth was main determinants of the community structure. According to a joint species distribution model within the HMSC framework, species richness tended to be higher in forest than in alpine tundra habitat but was only weakly associated with temperature and snow depth. However, we observed stronger and more diverse impacts of these covariates on individual species. Occurrence at baits by habitat generalists (red fox, golden eagle, and common raven) typically increased at low temperatures and high snow depth, probably due to increased energetic demands and lower abundance of natural prey in harsh winter conditions. On the contrary, occurrence at baits by forest specialists (e.g., Eurasian jay) tended to decrease in deep snow, which is possibly a consequence of reduced bait detectability and accessibility. In general, the influence of environmental covariates on species richness and occurrence at baits was lower in alpine tundra than in forests, and habitat generalists dominated the scavenger communities in both forest and alpine tundra. Following forecasted climate change, altered environmental conditions are likely to cause range expansion of boreal species and range contraction of typical alpine species such as the arctic fox.

Currently, KB is transitioning to a seasonally ice-free region because of climate change. This ecological shift has been hypothesized to benefit polar bears in the near-term due to thinner ice with increased biological production, although this has not been demonstrated empirically. We assess sea-ice changes in KB together with changes in polar bear movements, seasonal ranges, body condition, and reproductive metrics obtained from capture-recapture (physical and genetic) and satellite telemetry studies during two study periods (1993-1997 and 2012-2016). The annual cycle of sea-ice habitat in KB shifted from a year-round ice platform (similar to 50% coverage in summer) in the 1990s to nearly complete melt-out in summer (<5% coverage) in the 2010s. The mean duration between sea-ice retreat and advance increased from 109 to 160 days (p = .004). Between the 1990s and 2010s, adult female (AF) seasonal ranges more than doubled in spring and summer and were significantly larger in all months. Body condition scores improved for all ages and both sexes. Mean litter sizes of cubs-of-the-year (C0s) and yearlings (C1s), and the number of C1s per AF, did not change between decades. The date of spring sea-ice retreat in the previous year was positively correlated with C1 litter size, suggesting smaller litters following years with earlier sea-ice breakup. Our study provides evidence for range expansion, improved body condition, and stable reproductive performance in the KB polar bear subpopulation. These changes, together with a likely increasing subpopulation abundance, may reflect the shift from thick, multiyear ice to thinner, seasonal ice with higher biological productivity.

Activity patterns are often driven by light cycles, which will have important consequences for species interactions. 2. We tested whether longer photoperiods lead to higher parasitism rates by a day-active parasitoid on its host using a laboratory experiment in which we independently varied daylength and the presence of ALAN. We then tested whether reduced nighttime temperature tempers the effect of ALAN. 3. We found that parasitism rate increased with daylength, with ALAN intensifying this effect only when the temperature was not reduced at night. The impact of ALAN was more pronounced under short daylength. Increased parasitoid activity was not compensated for by reduced life span, indicating that increased daylength leads to an increase in total parasitism effects on fitness. 4. To test the significance of increased parasitism rate for population dynamics, we developed a host-parasitoid model. The results of the model predicted an increase in time-to-equilibrium with increased daylength and, crucially, a threshold daylength above which interactions are unstable, leading to local extinctions. 5. Here we demonstrate that ALAN impact interacts with daylength and temperature by changing the interaction strength between a common day-active consumer species and its host in a predictable way.

Methods Using a comprehensive geographical sampling of 204 individuals from the species' entire range genotyped at seven nuclear and two mitochondrial loci, we reconstructed spatio-temporal diversification and demographic history of the common pheasant. We applied Bayesian phylogenetic inference to describe phylogeographic structure, generated a species tree and inferred demographic history within and migration between lineages. Moreover, to establish a taxonomic framework, we conducted a species delimitation analysis. Results The common pheasant diversified during the Late Pleistocene into eight distinct lineages. It originated at the edge of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau and spread to East and Central Asia. Only the widely distributed lowland lineage of East Asia displayed recent range expansion. Greater phylogeographic structure was identified elsewhere, with lineages showing no sign of recent demographic changes. One lineage in south-central China is the result of long-term isolation within a climatically stable but topographically complex region. In lineages from arid Central Asia and China, range expansions were impeded by repeated population fragmentation during dry glacial periods and by recent aridification. Main conclusions Spatio-temporal phylogeographic frameworks of widespread taxa such as the common pheasant provide valuable opportunities to identify divergent drivers of regional diversification.

The evolutionary history of the common pheasant is best reflected by its being split into three species.",,,,,"Liu, Yang/0000-0003-4580-5518",,,,,,,,,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,,,DEC,2020,47,12,,,,,2714,2727,,10.1111/jbi.13964,,SEP 2020,,,,,WOS:000570008200001,,,,,,

This lack of data is a missing link between our theoretical understanding of how diversity patterns can form and how they actually form in nature, and it hampers our ability to predict community responses to climate change. Here, we compare seed, seedling, and adult plant communities at 12 grassland sites with different climates in southern Norway to examine how community membership is interactively shaped by seed dispersal and local filtering, and how this process varies with climate across sites. To do this, we divide species at each site into two groups:locally transientspecies, which occur as seeds but are rare or absent as adults (i.e., they arrive but are filtered out), andlocally persistentspecies, which occur consistently as adults in annual vegetation surveys. We then ask how and why locally transient species are disfavored during community assembly. Our results led to four main conclusions: (1) the total numbers of seeds and species that arrived, but failed to establish locally persistent populations, rose with temperature, indicating an increase in the realized effects of local filtering on community assembly, as well as an increase in the number of species poised to rapidly colonize those warmer sites if local conditions change in their favor, (2) locally transient species were selectively filtered out during seedling emergence, but not during seedling establishment, (3) selective filtering was partly driven by species climate preferences, exemplified by the poor performance of seeds dispersing outside of their realized climate niches into colder and drier foreign climates, and (4) locally transient species had traits that likely made them better dispersers (i.e., smaller seeds) but poorer competitors for light (i.e., shorter statures and less persistent clonal connections) than locally persistent species, potentially explaining why these species arrived to new sites but did not establish locally persistent adult populations. Our study is the first to combine seed, seedling, and adult survey data across sites to rigorously characterize how seed dispersal and local filtering govern community membership and shape climate-associated vegetation patterns.",,,,"Vandvik, Vigdis/C-1924-2008","Vandvik, Vigdis/0000-0003-4651-4798; Meineri, Eric/0000-0001-8825-8986",,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,OCT,2020,101,10,,,,,,,,10.1002/ecy.3061,,SEP 2020,,,,,WOS:000566835100001,32239491,,,,,

We develop a framework for understanding the joint influence of these processes in changing the mean and variance of expansion speed and its underlying traits. Our synthesis of recent laboratory experiments supports the consistent role of evolution in accelerating expansion speed on average, and highlights unexpected diversity in how evolution can influence variability in speed: results not well predicted by current theory.

Managers require better information regarding landowner attitudes about hunting before implementing harvest regulations intended to mitigate conflicts in suburban areas. To address this need, in 2013, we surveyed landowners to identify properties that allowed bear hunting in 3 suburban areas of Pennsylvania, USA where bear sightings or human-bear conflicts have increased. We then used location data obtained for 29 bears equipped with global positioning system transmitters from 2010 to 2012 to model their resource selection in the study area. We assessed the influence of hunting access, housing density, land cover, and topographic variables on radio-marked black bears monitored 10 days before, during, and after the bear hunting season. We found that resource selection of radio-marked bears was similar for all 3 periods and bears selected for forested land in all 3 seasons and herbaceous cover in the pre-hunting and hunting periods. Resource selection by bears was not influenced by hunting access in the pre-hunting and hunting periods. For the post-hunting period, lands closed to hunting had support as the second-best model. All of the radio-marked bears in our study were vulnerable to harvest. However, they did not change resource selection during the hunting season, nor did they avoid areas open to hunting.

Here, we used meteorological station daily mean, maximum and minimum temperature data from 27 stations in the range of wild M. glyptostroboides and the phenology data for M. glyptostroboides to calculate the variation of growing season and climatically suitable habitat over the last half century (1960-2016). We found that the daily T-max, T-min, and T-mean within the M. glyptostroboides range increased significantly at a rate of 1.02 degrees C, 0.74 degrees C, and 0.68 degrees C per 100 years from 1960 to 2016. The average start of the growing season (GSS) had advanced 1.12 days/decade, the average end (GSE) had delayed 0.20 days/decade, and the length of the growing season (GSL) had expanded by 0.92 days/decade, while the active accumulated temperature (AAT) had increased 28.15 degrees.days/decade. The climatically suitable area contracted 1174.56 km(2) at the rate of 370.8 km(2)/decade, and the lower and upper elevation limits of the M. glyptostroboides were at 989-1170 m, which was shrank by 27 m over the past 57 years.

We combined a qualitative analysis of social media information with field data from multiple taxa, data from citizen science projects, and questionnaires addressed to managers of protected areas. Both social media information and field data suggest that a reduction of human disturbance allowed wildlife to exploit new habitats and increase daily activity. The field data confirmed some positive effects on wildlife conservation, such as an increase in species richness in temporarily less-disturbed habitats, a higher breeding success of an aerial insectivorous bird, and reduction of road-killing of both amphibians and reptiles. Despite some positive effects, our data also highlighted several negative impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on wildlife. The lower human disturbance linked to lockdown was in fact beneficial for invasive alien species. Results from questionnaires addressed to managers of protected areas highlighted that the COVID-19 lockdown interrupted actions for the control of invasive alien species, and hampered conservation activities targeting threatened taxa.

Accidental release from the animal industry is an important cause of biological invasions, and allows for the clear determination of the source of non-native species. Such examples of invasion can be beneficial for studies on the relative importance of local environments by comparing establishment successes from different sources. Nutrias (Myocastor coypus), originally introduced to South Korea for meat and fur production, escaped from local farms into the wild in the late 1990s. Using ensemble species distribution models (ESDM), we assessed 1) suitable habitat conditions for nutrias, 2) establishment success from different source localities after the nutrias' escape from farms, and 3) changes in habitat suitability based on regional climate scenarios. We found that the distribution of nutrias was largely influenced by temperature regime (i.e., minimum temperature during the winter; 44.1 +/- 11.4% of variable contribution in the ESDM) and invasion success of nutrias that had escaped from different local farms was also related to the local climate conditions. Escaped nutrias were widely observed around the farms with favorable habitat conditions. Our model predicted a gradual expansion of habitats suitable for nutrias; however, core habitats are isolated by high-mountain ridges and watershed boundaries.

This parasite has infested most host populations along the Pacific coast of North America to the south. We estimated that 25% of susceptible hosts on Calvert Island were parasitized during summer 2018 and winter 2019. Steady infestation of mud shrimp on Calvert Island confirmed that the invasive bopyrid has successfully established itself in a novel host population 300 km further north than previously recorded, but with lower parasite prevalence than in the known invasive range, where heavy infestations have been implicated in host population declines. Prevalence rates increased with host size as previously documented, with a minimum infestation size of 10.6 mm carapace length. The parasite has a planktonic larval phase, suggesting that its spread along the coast is not limited to transport via boat traffic. The prognosis for the persistence of Upogebia in Canada and further north is unclear, but population declines further south in the presence of O. griffenis provide a troubling outlook.

Here, we combine new and published whole-genome and exome sequences with targeted genotyping ofAgoutito investigate the evolutionary history of local seasonal camouflage adaptation in the Pacific Northwest. We find evidence of significantly elevated inbreeding and mutational load in coastal winter-brown hares, consistent with a recent range expansion into temperate coastal environments that incurred indirect fitness costs. The genome-wide distribution of introgression tract lengths supports a pulse of hybridization near the end of the last glacial maximum, which may have facilitated range expansion via introgression of winter-brown camouflage variation. However, signatures of a selective sweep atAgoutiindicate a much more recent spread of winter-brown camouflage. Through simulations, we show that the delay between the hybrid origin and subsequent selective sweep of the recessive winter-brown allele can be largely attributed to the limits of natural selection imposed by simple allelic dominance. We argue that while hybridization during periods of environmental change may provide a critical reservoir of adaptive variation at range edges, the probability and pace of local adaptation will strongly depend on population demography and the genetic architecture of introgressed variation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0147,1537-5323,,,,SEP 1,2020,196,3,,,,,316,332,,10.1086/710022,,,,,,,WOS:000560929700005,32813993,,,,,

Besides changes in population-level interspecific interactions, such range shifts may also cause changes in functional structure within the host assemblages, which can result in losses or gains in ecosystem functions. Because consumer-resource dynamics are central to community regulation, functional reorganization driven by introduction of new consumer species can have large consequences on ecosystem functions. Here we experimentally examine the extent to which the recent poleward range expansion of the intertidal grazer limpetScurria viridulaalong the coast of Chile has altered the role of the resident congeneric limpetS. zebrina,and whether the net collective impacts, and functional structure, of the entire herbivore guild have been modified by the introduction of this new member. We examined the functional role ofScurriaspecies in controlling ephemeral algal cover, bare rock availability, and species richness and diversity, and compared the effects in the region of range overlap against their respective native abutted ranges. Experiments showed depression of per capita effects of the range-expanded species within the region of overlap, suggesting environmental conditions negatively affect individual performance. In contrast, effects ofS. zebrinawere commonly invariant at its range edge. When comparing single species versus polycultures, effects on bare rock cover were altered by the presence of the otherScurriaspecies, suggesting competition betweenScurriaspecies. Importantly, although the magnitude ofS. viridulaeffects at the range overlap was reduced, its addition to the herbivore guild seems to complement and intensify the role of the guild in reducing green algal cover, species richness and increasing bare space provision. Our study thus highlights that range expansion of an herbivore can modify the functional guild structure in the recipient community. It also highlights the complexity of predicting how functional structure may change in the face of natural or human-induced range expansions.

Future range extension, and large increases in populations and in impacts on freshwater systems, can be expected. Beavers are now recolonising densely populated, intensely modified, low-relief regions, such as England, the Netherlands, Belgium, and north-west Germany.

Yet, no studies directly compared the changes in range-limiting traits within the same species during both types of range expansions. To increase our mechanistic understanding of range expansions, it is crucial to disentangle the contributions of plastic and genetic changes in these traits. The aim of this study was to test for plastic and evolutionary changes in heat tolerance, life history, and behavior, and compare these during range expansions toward warmer and cooler regions. Using laboratory experiments we reconstructed the thermal performance curves (TPCurves) of larval life history (survival, growth, and development rates) and larval heat tolerance (CTmax) across two recent range expansions from the core populations in southern France toward a warmer (southeastern Spain) and a cooler (northwestern Spain) region in Europe by the damselflyIschnura elegans. First-generation larvae from field-collected mothers were reared across a range of temperatures (16 degrees-28 degrees C) in incubators. The range expansion to the warmer region was associated with the evolution of a greater ability to cope with high temperatures (increased mean and thermal plasticity of CTmax), faster development, and, in part, a faster growth, indicating a higher time constraints caused by a shorter time frame available for larval development associated with a transition to a greater voltinism. Our results thereby support the emerging pattern that plasticity in heat tolerance alone is inadequate to adapt to new thermal regimes. The range expansion to the cooler region was associated with faster growth indicating countergradient variation without a change in CTmax. The evolution of a faster growth rate during both range expansions could be explained by a greater digestive efficiency rather than an increased food intake. Our results highlight that range expansions to warmer and cooler regions can result in similar evolutionary changes in the TPCurves for life history, and no opposite changes in heat tolerance.",,,,"Carbonell, Jose Antonio/AAI-1857-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,OCT,2020,101,10,,,,,,,,10.1002/ecy.3134,,AUG 2020,,,,,WOS:000560501300001,32691873,,,,,

We examine isolation by distance versus resistance to barriers (ocean current boundaries) against a background of post-glacial habitat expansion in a small benthic fish of the Adriatic Sea. Location Adriatic Sea, Eastern Mediterranean. Taxon Tripterygion tripteronotum. Methods We performed population genetic analyses using mitochondrial control region sequences of 550 individuals from 25 locations sampled along the Eastern Adriatic coast. Investigations of population structure included differentiation tests, cluster analyses and distance-based redundancy analysis. We then ran Lagrangian simulations of passive larval drift to examine correlations among population structure, geographic distance and the Adriatic gyre system. To test for signatures of a post-glacial range expansion, we modelled the demographic history of the populations and examined the geographic distribution of genetic diversity. Results Genetic population structure corresponded to the Adriatic gyres without additional effect of geographic distance. Inference of northward-biased gene flow between the northern and the Istrian gyre was consistent with simulated trajectories of passive drift, whereas the phylogeographic break coinciding with the boundary between the Central and the Northern Adriatic gyre was stronger than predicted by drift simulations. Genetic connectivity of populations within gyres was high. Genetic signatures of population expansion were consistent with a rapid post-glacial recolonization of the northern Adriatic. Main conclusions The combination of dense sampling and passive drift simulation allowed us to distinguish among effects of geographic distance, oceanographic features and palaeoenvironmental changes on current population structure.

Because of the potential for enemy release of invasive nonnative plant species from species-specific soil pathogens, invasive plants may be able to shift ranges more readily than native plant species. Additionally, changing climatic conditions may alter soil microbial functioning, affecting plant-microbe interactions. We evaluated the effects of site, plant-soil microbe interactions, altered climate, and their interactions on the growth and germination of three congeneric shrub species, two native to southern and central Florida (Eugenia foetida and E. axillaris), and one nonnative invasive from south America (E. uniflora). We measured germination and biomass for these plant species in growth chambers grown under live and sterile soils from two sites within their current range, and one site in their expected range, simulating current (2010) and predicted future (2050) spring growing season temperatures in the new range. Soil microbes (microscopic bacteria, fungi, viruses and other organisms) had a net negative effect on the invasive plant, E. uniflora, across all sites and temperature treatments. This negative response to soil microbes suggests that E. uniflora's invasive success and potential for range expansion are due to other contributing factors, e.g. higher germination and growth relative to native Eugenia. The effect of soil microbes on the native species depended on the geographic provenance of the microbes, and this may influence range expansion of these native species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2041-2851,,,,,AUG 18,2020,12,5,,,,,,,plaa040,10.1093/aobpla/plaa040,,,,,,,WOS:000575446100001,32968475,,,,,

Here, we test foundational hypotheses regarding the origins and maintenance of interspecific territoriality, and evaluate the role of interspecific territoriality and hybridization in shaping species distributions and transitions from parapatry to sympatry in sister species of North American perching birds (Passeriformes). We find that interspecific territoriality is pervasive among sympatric sister species pairs, and that interspecifically territorial species pairs have diverged more recently than sympatric noninterspecifically territorial pairs. None of the foundational hypotheses alone explains the observed patterns of interspecific territoriality, but our results support the idea that some cases of interspecific territoriality arise from misdirected intraspecific aggression while others are evolved responses to resource competition. The combination of interspecific territoriality and hybridization appears to be an unstable state associated with parapatry, whereas species that are interspecifically territorial and do not hybridize are able to achieve extensive fine- and coarse-scale breeding range overlap.

Such patterns of density-dependent dispersal (DDD) are expected to shape the dynamics, spatial spread, and invasiveness of populations. Despite their ecological importance, empirical evidence for the evolution of DDD patterns remains extremely scarce. This is especially relevant because rapid evolution of dispersal traits has now been empirically confirmed in several taxa. Changes in DDD of dispersing populations could help clarify not only the role of DDD in dispersal evolution, but also the possible pattern of subsequent range expansion. Here, we investigate the relationship between dispersal evolution and DDD using a long-term experimental evolution study onDrosophila melanogaster. We compared the DDD patterns of four dispersal-selected populations and their non-selected controls. The control populations showed negative DDD, which was stronger in females than in males. In contrast, the dispersal-selected populations showed DDD, where neither males nor females exhibited DDD. We compare our results with previous evolutionary predictions that focused largely on positive DDD, and highlight how the direction of evolutionary change depends on the initial DDD pattern of a population.

Model projections indicate significant variations in future climate conditions of North America, and the habitats of woodland mammals of this continent may be particularly sensitive to changes in climate. We report on the potential spatial distributions of 13 wide-ranging, relatively common species of North American woodland mammals under future climate scenarios. We examined the potential influence of the mean and seasonal climate variables on the distribution of species. Presence-only occurrence records of species, four predictor variables, two future climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5), and two time steps (current and 2070) were used to build species' distribution models using a maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt). Our results suggested that overall, 11 of the 13 species are likely to gain climatically suitable space (regions where climate conditions will be similar to those of area currently occupied) at the continental scale, but American martenMartes americanaand 'woodland' caribouRangifer tarandusare likely to lose suitable climate range by 2070. Furthermore, climate space is likely to be expanding northwards under future climate scenarios for most of the mammals, and many jurisdictions in the border region between Canada and the USA are likely to lose iconic species, such as mooseAlces alces. We identified regions as potential in situ and ex situ climate change refugia, which are increasingly considered to be important for biodiversity conservation. The model results suggest significant implications for conservation planning for the 13 mammalian species under global climate change, especially at fine spatial scales.

In this study, we investigated the impact of climate change on the distribution of four terrestrial orchid species (Orchis anthropophora,Orchis militaris,Orchis purpureaandOrchis simia).

The results revealed an increase in suitable habitat area forO. anthropophora,O. purpureaandO. simiaunder each RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) scenario, while a decrease was observed forO. militaris. Furthermore, all four of the orchids showed a shift to higher latitudes under the three RCPs leading to a significant range extension under mild climate change. Under severe climate change, a significant decline in the distribution area at the warm edge of their distributions was observed.

We used a double digestion restriction site-associated DNA sequencing technique (dd-RAD seq) and discovered 8,181 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 189 ticks from across the geographic range of the species. Genetic diversity was low, particularly when considering the broad geographic range of this species.

Additionally, phenotypic attributes related to dispersal and persistence may affect the time and manner in which species respond to geoclimatic changes. We performed a comparative phylogeographical study within a plant community of the South American Arid Diagonal to assess whether genetic patterns are better explained by climatic changes or volcanisms, taking into account the possible influence of life form and dispersal syndromes of the focal species. Chloroplast intergenic spacers were sequenced for five plant species. Genealogy, divergence time estimates, demographic and range expansion analyses were performed. Approximate Bayesian computation was used to test plausible shared phylogeographic scenarios. Climatically stable areas during the last glacial period were inferred with distribution modeling. Results showed that most species were split into northern and southern lineages separated by a phylogeographic break at around 37.5 degrees S, with the northern populations being genetically less diverse, inhabiting both climatically stable and unstable areas, but being severely affected by intense Plio-Pleistocene magmatic activity; the southern populations, less influenced by volcanism, appeared to be genetically more diverse and occupied climatically stable areas through time. Most recent range expansions and effective population size increases occurred after most of the volcanic episodes, before and during the Last Glacial Maximum.

To study these factors, P. armatus was collected every two weeks over a 20-month period (April 2017 to November 2018) on an intertidal oyster reef within its non-native range in Charleston, SC. Crab abundance, size, sex, and ovigery status were recorded. In addition, a laboratory experiment was conducted to determine the time elapsed between broods for large vs. small adult females. Petrolisthes armatus abundances varied seasonally and were highest in the summers of both years. Adults were collected in April after a mild winter (2017), indicating overwintering occurred, but after a harsh winter (2018), no crabs were collected on the reef the following spring, with adults first collected in July. Peak ovigery rates reached 95% of adult female crabs in some summer months. Juvenile recruits matured and contributed to the reproductive population 6-8 weeks after first being collected in the intertidal oyster habitat. In the laboratory experiment, the median time between broods was 6 days (range 2-22 days). Females were observed with new broods immediately post-molt and also several days following their molt, suggesting mating occurs for females in intermolt and post-molt states. Study results indicate that overwintering success affects the timing of the start of the reproductive season, its duration, and total annual brood production. The laboratory observations suggest rapid sequential brood production occurs for this species in the non-native range. Brood production rates and evidence that females mate in intermolt and post-molt states are new information for this species and are consistent with previous observations of high reproductive output in the non-native range.

However, in the case of an ongoing biological invasion, deciphering whether genetic structure represents landscape connectivity or founder effects is particularly challenging. We examined the modes of dispersal (natural and human-aided) and the factors (landscape or founders history) shaping genetic structure in range edge invasive populations of the Asian tiger mosquito,Aedes albopictus, in the region of Grenoble (Southeast France).

The relative role of dispersal modes was estimated using biological dispersal capabilities and landscape genetics approaches using genome-wide SNP dataset. We demonstrate that both natural and human-aided dispersal have promoted the expansion of populations. Populations in diffuse urban areas, representing highly suitable habitat forA. albopictus, tend to disperse less, while roads facilitate long-distance dispersal. Yet, demographic bottlenecks during introduction played a major role in shaping the genetic variability of these range edge populations. The present study is one of the few investigating the role of founder effects and ongoing expansion processes in shaping spatial patterns of genetic variation in an invasive species at the landscape scale.

This has often been attributed to a response to selection under mate and/or pollinator limitation. However, range expansion can also cause reduced inbreeding depression, and this could facilitate the evolution of selfing in the absence of mate or pollinator limitation. Here, we explore this idea using spatially explicit individual-based simulations of a range expansion, in which inbreeding depression, variation in self-incompatibility (SI), and mate availability evolve. Under a wide range of conditions, the simulated range expansion brought about the evolution of selfing after the loss of SI in range-marginal populations. Under conditions of high recombination between the self-incompatibility locus (S-locus) and viability loci, SC remained marginal in the expanded metapopulation and could not invade the range core, which remained self-incompatible. In contrast, under low recombination and migration rates, SC was frequently able to displace SI in the range core by maintaining its association with a genomic background with purged genetic load. We conclude that the evolution of inbreeding depression during a range expansion promotes the evolution of SC at range margins, especially under high rates of recombination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1010-061X,1420-9101,,,,SEP,2020,33,9,,,,,1235,1244,,10.1111/jeb.13665,,JUL 2020,,,,,WOS:000563837300001,32557922,,,,,

However, only a few studies have simultaneously considered the influence of both extrinsic and intrinsic mechanistic drivers; there are still no studies on the roles of extrinsic and intrinsic drivers that regulate such species changes. We investigated how species will shift their geographical ranges to cope with future climate change and analysed the relative importance of the mechanistic drivers in governing species range shifts. Location Sixteen countries in South, West and North Europe. Methods We used ensemble species distribution models on the European continental scale to predict 105 odonate species in response to climate change in the future decades until 2080s under three emission scenarios. We evaluated the projected changes in four community metrics (distribution area, optimum position, leading edge and trailing edge) and investigated how these changes are driven by extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Results The odonate species were predicted to shift their range margins poleward, with a higher migration rate towards the trailing edge (2.38-10.34 km/year) than the leading edge (1.13-2.00 km/year). Contrary to the assumption that the response of the odonate species to climate change will linearly accelerate over time, the distribution areas of odonate species were predicted to increase until 2050s and then decline until 2080s under RCP 2.6 (representative concentration pathway). However, their distributions under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 were predicted to decrease over time, with a higher rate under RCP 8.5. Overall, environmental preference and habitat override dispersal ability govern the range shift of odonate species.

These pressures, which include pollutants, sewage, runoff and debris, temperature increases, hardened shorelines/structures, and light and acoustic pollution, have resulted in new evolutionary landscapes for coastal marine organisms. Marine environmental changes influenced by urbanization may create new selective regimes or may influence neutral evolution via impacts on gene flow or partitioning of genetic diversity across seascapes. While some urban selective pressures, such as hardened surfaces, are similar to those experienced by terrestrial species, others, such as oxidative stress, are specific to aquatic environments. Moreover, spatial and temporal scales of evolutionary responses may differ in the ocean due to the spatial extent of selective pressures and greater capacity for dispersal/gene flow. Here, we present a conceptual framework and synthesis of current research on evolutionary responses of marine organisms to urban pressures. We review urban impacts on genetic diversity and gene flow and examine evidence that marine species are adapting, or are predicted to adapt, to urbanization over rapid evolutionary time frames. Our findings indicate that in the majority of studies, urban stressors are correlated with reduced genetic diversity. Genetic structure is often increased in urbanized settings, but artificial structures can also act as stepping stones for some hard-surface specialists, promoting range expansion. Most evidence for rapid adaptation to urban stressors comes from studies of heritable tolerance to pollutants in a relatively small number of species; however, the majority of marine ecotoxicology studies do not test directly for heritability.

We modelled the phenological window for successful larval release and development (WLR) in order to predict poleward expansion of the invasive crabHemigrapsus sanguineusalong the Atlantic coast of North America and north Europe. WLR quantifies the number of opportunities (in days) when larval release leads to a successful completion of the larval phase; WLR depends on the effects of temperature on the duration of larval development and survival. Successful larval development is a necessary requirement for the establishment of self-persistent local populations. WLR was computed from a mechanistic model, based on in situ temperature time series and a laboratory-calibrated curve predicting duration of larval development from temperature. As a validation step, we checked that model predictions of the time of larval settlement matched observations from the field for our local population (Helgoland, North Sea). We then applied our model to the North American shores because larvae from our European population showed, in the laboratory, similar responses to temperature to those of a North American population. WLR correctly predicted the northern distribution limit in North American shores, where the poleward expansion ofH. sanguineusappear to have stalled (as of 2015). For north Europe, whereH. sanguineusis a recent invader, WLR predicted ample room for poleward expansion towards NE England and S Norway. We also explored the importance of year-to-year variation in temperature for WLR and potential expansion: variations in WLR highlighted the role of heat waves as likely promoters of recruitment subsidising sink populations located at the distribution limits.

However, the dynamic nature of the major parasite-related processes has been rarely taken into account until now, while the residence time of invaders in colonized regions was shown to be associated to crucial changes in parasite communities. Here, we strive to bridge this gap using a temporal survey of rodent populations along one invasion route of the exotic house mouseMus musculus domesticusthat currently invades North Senegal. In this study, we investigated whether gastrointestinal helminth (GIH) assemblages changed over time in native (Mastomys erythroleucus) and/or invasive (M. m. domesticus) rodent populations sampled at an invasion front, and whether these potential changes may be associated to the invasion success of the exotic mouse. Four years separated two rodent sampling campaigns (2013 and 2016/17) in six localities. Despite being relatively short, the timeframe considered here allowed to evidence significant patterns in rodent communities and their GIH assemblages. At the host community level, we showed that the exotic mouse was now established at all sites, becoming the dominant species in sites where it was not recorded before. At the GIH community level, increased infection of the single shared cestode (Mathevotaenia symmetrica) in both rodent species brought support to the spill-back hypothesis. Infection levels of GIH that remained low at the invasion front in invading mice over time also supported the enemy release hypothesis.

Extreme storms can rapidly overcome this lag, especially for coastal species, but how will storm-driven expansion shape intraspecific genetic variation? Do storms provide recruits only from the nearest sources, or from more distant sources? Answers to these questions have ecological and evolutionary implications, but empirical evidence is absent from the literature. In 2017, Hurricane Irma provided an opportunity to address this knowledge gap at the northern range limit of the neotropical black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) on the Atlantic coast of Florida, USA. We observed massive post-hurricane increases in beach-strandedA. germinanspropagules at, and past, this species' present day range margin when compared to a previously surveyed nonhurricane year. Yet, propagule dispersal does not guarantee subsequent establishment and reproductive success (i.e., effective dispersal). We also evaluated prior effective dispersal along this coastline with isolatedA. germinanstrees identified beyond the most northern established population. We used 12 nuclear microsatellite loci to genotype 896 hurricane-driven drift propagules from nine sites and 10 isolated trees from four sites, determined their sources of origin, and estimated dispersal distances. Almost all drift propagules and all isolated trees came from the nearest sources. This research suggests that hurricanes are a prerequisite for poleward range expansion of a coastal tree species and that storms can shape the expanding gene pool by providing almost exclusively range-margin genotypes.

In contrast to previous studies, herds visited the newly available area within a month of the fence removal, and the maximum distance they moved into the new area was reached between 5 and 9 months after the fence removal.

Using genome sequences, we show that invasive populations of the African fig fly, Zaprionus indianus, have less genetic diversity than conspecific populations in their native range and that diversity is proportionally lower in regions of the genome experiencing low recombination rates. This result suggests that selection may have played a role in lowering diversity in the invasive populations. We next use interspecific comparisons to show that genetic diversity remains relatively high in invasive populations of Z. indianus when compared with other closely related species. By comparing genetic diversity in orthologous gene regions, we also show that the genome-wide landscape of genetic diversity differs between invasive and native populations of Z. indianus indicating that invasion not only affects amounts of genetic diversity but also how that diversity is distributed across the genome.

However, the role of plasticity in rapid adaptation in nature remains poorly understood. We here use the invasion of the horned beetleOnthophagus taurusin the United States during the last half century to study the contribution of ancestral plasticity and post-invasion evolution of plastic responses in rapid population differentiation. We document latitudinal variation in life history and morphology, including genetic compensation in development time and body size, likely adaptive responses to seasonal constraints in the North. However, clinal variation in development time and size was strongly dependent on rearing temperature, suggesting that population differentiation in plasticity played a critical role in successful adaptation on ecological timescales. Clinal variation in wing shape was independent of ancestral plasticity, but correlated with derived plasticity, consistent with evolutionary interdependence. In contrast, clinal variation in tibia shape aligned poorly with thermal plasticity. Overall, this study suggests that post-invasion evolution of plasticity contributed to range expansions and concurrent adaptation to novel climatic conditions.",,,,,"Rohner, Patrick T./0000-0002-9840-1050",,,,,,,,,,,,0014-3820,1558-5646,,,,SEP,2020,74,9,,,,,2059,2072,,10.1111/evo.14045,,JUL 2020,,,,,WOS:000544428600001,32558925,,,,,

Shree; Srivathsa, Sahana; Dey, Sutirth",,,Mate-finding dispersal reduces local mate limitation and sex bias in dispersal,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sex-biased dispersal (SBD) often skews the local sex ratio in a population. This can result in a shortage of mates for individuals of the less-dispersive sex. Such mate limitation can lead to Allee effects in populations that are small or undergoing range expansion, consequently affecting their survival, growth, stability and invasion speed. Theory predicts that mate shortage can lead to either an increase or a decrease in the dispersal of the less-dispersive sex. However, neither of these predictions have been empirically validated. To investigate how SBD-induced mate limitation affects dispersal of the less-dispersive sex, we usedDrosophila melanogasterpopulations with varying dispersal propensities. To rule out any mate-independent density effects, we examined the behavioural plasticity of dispersal in the presence of mates as well as same-sex individuals with differential dispersal capabilities. In the presence of high-dispersive mates, the dispersal of both male and female individuals was significantly increased. However, the magnitude of this increase was much larger in males than in females, indicating that the former shows greater mate-finding dispersal. Moreover, the dispersal of either sex did not change when dispersing alongside high- or low-dispersive individuals of the same sex. This suggested that the observed plasticity in dispersal was indeed due to mate-finding dispersal, and not mate-independent density effects. Strong mate-finding dispersal can diminish the magnitude of sex bias in dispersal. This can modulate the evolutionary processes that shape range expansions and invasions, depending on the population size. In small populations, mate-finding dispersal can ameliorate Allee effects. However, in large populations, it can dilute the effects of spatial sorting.",,,,"Mishra, Abhishek/ABD-2521-2020; Tung, Sudipta/D-5754-2015","Mishra, Abhishek/0000-0001-8540-5055; Tung, Sudipta/0000-0002-3201-3303",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,SEP,2020,89,9,,,,,2089,2098,,10.1111/1365-2656.13278,,JUL 2020,,,,,WOS:000544444600001,32535925,,,,,

Time available to perform those activities is determined by thermal tolerances and environmental temperatures. Estimates of activity time might enhance our ability to predict suitable areas for species' persistence in face of climate warming, compared to the exclusive use of environmental temperatures, without considering thermal tolerances. We compare the ability of environmental temperatures and estimates of activity time to predict the geographic distribution of a tropical lizard,Tropidurus torquatus. We compared 105 estimates of activity time, resulting from the combination of four methodological decisions: 1) how to estimate daily environmental temperature variation (modeling a sinusoid wave ranging from monthly minimum to maximum temperature, extrapolating from operative temperatures measured in field or using biophysical projections of microclimate)? 2) In which temperature range are animals considered active? 3) Should these ranges be determined from body temperatures obtained in laboratory or in field? And 4) should thermoregulation simulations be included in estimations? We show that models using estimates of activity time made with the sinusoid and biophysical methods had higher predictive accuracy than those using environmental temperatures alone. Estimates made using the central 90% of temperatures measured in a thermal gradient as the temperature range for activity also ranked higher than environmental temperatures. Thermoregulation simulations did not improve model accuracy. Precipitation ranked higher than thermally related predictors. Activity time adds important information to distribution modeling and should be considered as a predictor in studies of the distribution of ectotherms.

We investigated how muscid genera have assembled in the continents by historical dispersal events. Location Global (except Antarctica). Taxon Muscidae, Diptera, Insecta. Methods We compiled a dataset of 181 species, which provided geographic information for 67 genera as terminals. Phylogenetic and geographic data were fitted by five dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis models based on dispersal constraints. Based on the event inferences of the best-fit model, we quantified the direction and frequency of dispersals through time in absolute numbers and in relation to the number of lineages. Results The best-fit model was 'unrestricted routes', which inferred 48 events of dispersals: 66% were trans-climatic events and 81% were transoceanic events. The direction of the dispersals was strongly asymmetric: the Neotropical (NEO) region was the primary source of lineages for all other regions and the Palearctic (PAL) was the secondary source. The relative frequency of dispersal events through time plot was marked by three phases: the early peak of the frequency (40-35 million years ago [Ma]), a valley of low frequencies (30-20 Ma), and the recent peak (15-5 Ma). Trans-climatic dispersals from the NEO to the PAL region occurred in all phases. Lineages of the Cyrtoneurininae showed a low frequency of dispersal events and most of the terminals (11 of 15) were endemic to the NEO region. Conclusion The Muscidae family originated in the Neotropical region and more recent dispersal events to the Palearctic region established the scenario for lineages to diversify and spread worldwide. Trans-climatic dispersals were more frequent than cis-events and tropical niche conservatism was not the underlying mechanism for the whole clade.

Recent research has demonstrated that this range expansion can be further enhanced by positive vegetation-microclimate feedbacks whereby woody canopies induce local nocturnal warming, which reduces freeze-induced damage and favors the establishment of woody plants. However, this local positive feedback can be counteracted by biotic drivers such as browsing and the associated consumption of shrub biomass. The joint effects of large-scale climate warming and local-scale microclimate feedbacks on woody vegetation dynamics in these ecotones remain poorly understood. Here, we used a combination of experimental and modeling approaches to investigate the effects of woody cover on microclimate and the consequent implications on ecological stability in North American coastal ecosystems. We found greater browsing pressure and significant warming (similar to 2 degrees C) beneath shrub canopies compared to adjacent grasslands, which reduces shrub seedlings' exposure to cold damage. Cold sensitivity is evidenced by the significant decline in xylem hydraulic conductivity in shrub seedlings when temperatures dropped below -2 degrees C. Despite the negative browsing-vegetation feedback, a small increase in minimum temperature can induce critical transitions from grass to woody plant dominance. Our framework also predicts the threshold temperature of -7 degrees C for mangrove-salt marsh ecotones on the Atlantic coast of Florida. Above this reference temperature a critical transition may occur from salt marsh to mangrove vegetation, in agreement with empirical studies. Thus, the interaction between ongoing global warming trends and microclimate feedbacks may significantly alter woody vegetation dynamics and ecological stability in coastal ecosystems where woody plant expansion is primarily constrained by extreme low temperature events.",,,,,"Mote, Safa/0000-0001-5905-3842",,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,SEP,2020,101,9,,,,,,,e03107,10.1002/ecy.3107,,JUN 2020,,,,,WOS:000543230000001,32452021,,,,,

However, disturbances that alter interactions between resident and invading species could also affect invasion success. In northeast Florida, the black mangrove Avicennia germinans is expanding into salt marshes, where it interacts with the dead litter (wrack) of the native marsh cordgrass Spartina alterniflora. From 2015-2017, we performed monthly surveys before and after 2 hurricanes in 3 marsh microhabitats (bare sediment, vegetation, wrack) to quantify mangrove propagule and seedling densities. Wrack increased propagule retention up to 10 times relative to other microhabitats. Hurricanes did not directly harm mangrove propagules or seedlings. However, storm surge relocated wrack to upland environments, which indirectly inhibited mangroves by temporarily disrupting the facilitative effects of wrack on propagule recruitment and exposing intertidal bare patches that decreased propagule retention and seedling establishment. Wrack remained absent from intertidal areas for 1-3 mo. Because hurricane season overlaps with propagule recruitment, hurricane timing and wrack return time to intertidal areas influence the degree that hurricanes disrupt wrack-mangrove interactions. We demonstrate that large-scale disturbances can negatively and indirectly affect invader recruitment by altering interactions with resident species.",,,,,"Blaze, Julie/0000-0002-1387-6154; Byers, James/0000-0001-9240-0287",,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,JUN 25,2020,644,,,,,,65,74,,10.3354/meps13351,,,,,,,WOS:000547415400005,,,,,,

The effects of long-term hyposaline exposure on growth, metabolic rate, maximum food consumption and digestion were examined. Consistent with previous studies, lionfish were able to survive in hyposaline conditions for extended periods of time. However, lionfish in the most hyposaline treatment (10 psu) exhibited reduced growth under low food conditions, lower maximum metabolic rate, lower aerobic scope, lower maximum food consumption, took longer to digest a standardized meal size and occupied a greater percentage of their aerobic scope during digestion. Results suggest that (1) given the ability of lionfish to tolerate low salinity, updated range expansion models should incorporate salinity data to improve accuracy of predicted range expansion and (2) the invasion of lionfish into low salinity ecosystems, although a serious concern, will not likely lead to the same level of population increase observed for coral reef habitats due to the physiological costs associated with living in low salinities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,JUN 25,2020,644,,,,,,157,171,,10.3354/meps13340,,,,,,,WOS:000547415400012,,,,,,

The potential to adapt depends on genetic variation upon which selection can act. However, populations at species' range edges are often genetically depauperate. One mechanism increasing genetic variation is reshuffling existing variation through sex. Sex, however, can potentially limit adaptation by breaking up existing beneficial allele combinations (recombination load). The gene swamping hypothesis predicts this is specifically the case when populations expand along an abiotic gradient and asymmetric dispersal leads to numerous maladapted dispersers from the range core swamping the range edge. We used the ciliateTetrahymena thermophilaas a model for testing the gene swamping hypothesis. We performed replicated range expansions in landscapes with or without a pH-gradient, while simultaneously manipulating the occurrence of gene flow and sexual versus asexual reproduction. We show that sex accelerated evolution of local adaptation in the absence of gene flow, but hindered it in the presence of gene flow. However, sex affected adaptation independently of the pH-gradient, indicating that both abiotic gradients and the biotic gradient in population density lead to gene swamping.

We tested this hypothesis in the North American plant,Arabidopsis lyrata. We experimentally assessed mutational load by crossing plants of 20 populations from across the entire species range and by raising the offspring of within- and between-population crosses at five common garden sites within and beyond the range. Offspring performance was tracked over three growing seasons. The heterosis effect, depicting expressed mutational load, was increased in populations with heightened genomic estimates of load, longer expansion distance or long-term isolation, and a selfing mating system. The decline in performance of within-population crosses amounted to 80%.

Common features of such schemes are grassland strips at the edges of agricultural fields, and we examine potential co-benefits of these biodiversity set-asides for contributing to grassland connectivity. Although set-aside strips had negligible impact on landscape-scale species persistence (using metapopulation models parameterized for flying insects run on 267 landscapes of similar to 30 000 ha across England), they nonetheless improved connectivity in 74% (198/267) of landscapes (comparing landscapes with and without set-asides), as shown by range expansion rates increasing by up to 100%. Benefits of set-aside strips varied according to species type (high/low dispersal, high/low population density), but had little benefit for species with low dispersal and small population sizes, which generally failed to expand. High dispersal/high density species were already successful expanders regardless of set-asides (> 75% of simulations were successful without set-asides) although expansion rates were still improved when set-asides were added. Whilst alternative strategies for placement of set-aside strips (more/less aggregated), revealed no consensus 'better' strategy across species types, set-aside benefits were generally greatest in landscapes with intermediate availability of semi-natural grassland (0.5-4% cover). We conclude that small-scale set-asides have the potential to improve connectivity, which we expect to help some species track climate change, and connect habitat patches within existing climate space for others.

From a biogeographical perspective, these 2 processes lead to very similar results: a change in the distribution of species. Here, we considered Atlantic fish species that are recent newcomers in the Mediterranean Sea, using biological traits to assess their origin. For this purpose, we first re-evaluated all records of Atlantic fish species in the Mediterranean (n = 103) to exclude those not considered recent newcomers (n = 33). Based on faunistic data, we classified the true newcomers into 4 origin categories: alien, vagrant, range-expansion or cryptogenic. Then, we compared biological traits of species we characterised as aliens (n = 7), vagrants (n = 14) or range-expanders (n = 23). Finally, we re-assessed the origin of cryptogenic species (n = 26) using multivariate discriminant analysis, measuring the distance of individual species to the centroids of aliens, vagrants or range-expanders, allowing us to infer their probable 'mode of origin'. The body size, depth range, temperature range, habitat and ability to undertake long-distance migration were the most important traits that could be related to alien, vagrant or range-expanding fishes. It was possible to assign 10 cryptogenic species a specific origin category with reasonable confidence, while the remaining cryptogenic species combined trait values of different origin categories. These results indicate that biological trait analysis can be coupled with faunistic data to help assess the most likely origin of a newcomer species, thus informing management decisions.",,,,,"Arndt, Erik/0000-0002-7221-568X",,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,JUN 11,2020,643,,,,,,133,143,,10.3354/meps13353,,,,,,,WOS:000545931200010,,,,,,

Fragmentation by roads has had negative impacts on Fennoscandian alpine ecosystems, with reduction of habitats and connectivity for alpine species. Concurrently, infrastructure development causes influx of subsidies through roadkills and litter, which may facilitate expansion of boreal scavenging species, such as the red foxVulpes vulpes, which may intensify negative interactions with alpine species. Hence, understanding the impact of subsidies within marginal alpine areas is imperative for successful conservation and management of particularly vulnerable alpine species. We used snow tracking and camera traps in three alpine tundra areas in Norway to investigate whether the presence of boreal scavengers was positively associated with highways during winter, and if this contrasted the pattern of a critically endangered alpine species, the Arctic foxVulpes lagopus. In summer, artificial nests were used to assess whether predation risk was related to proximity to highways. During winter, the occurrence of red foxes was higher close to highways and decreased with increasing distance to highways, while the arctic fox showed no discernible pattern. Red fox occurrence increased with the number of edible items of anthropogenic origin located along highways, whereas arctic fox occurrence decreased. The overall predation risk of artificial nests during summer was high (>31.2%) and increased with proximity to the highway in the area with highest traffic volume. Synthesis and applications. Highways crossing alpine areas may attract boreal scavengers, possibly connected to increased access to subsidies of anthropogenic origin. Litter and food waste dominated available subsidies along highways in our study, and prevailing mitigating measures directed at reducing roadkill and movement restrictions may not be applicable to reduce negative effects of littering. We recommend actions focusing on informational campaigns, improved garbage disposal facilities and routines, and imposing fines for littering, to reduce negative impacts on vulnerable species. This is likely needed to achieve goals of 'no impact' from the physical loss of habitats due to road development.",,,,"Jensen, Henrik/B-5085-2011","Jensen, Henrik/0000-0001-7804-1564; Rod-Eriksen, Lars/0000-0003-0482-4384",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,SEP,2020,57,9,,,,,1861,1870,,10.1111/1365-2664.13668,,JUN 2020,,,,,WOS:000539592500001,,,,,,

Main conclusions Beech seems to be adapted to drought at the dry distribution margin with a high adaptive potential indicated by the lowest growth synchrony along the gradient. At the cold distribution margin, cold events in winter and spring were less important for growth than drought.

These naturally oligotrophic and cold-water streams, rivers, ponds and lakes are currently being impacted by a diverse range of anthropogenic pressures, such as accelerated climate change, permafrost thaw, land-use change, eutrophication, brownification and the replacement of northern biota with the range expansion of more southern species. Multiple stressors are rapidly changing Arctic freshwater systems as aquatic habitats are becoming more suitable for species originating from more southerly regions and thereby threatening biota adapted to cold waters. The livelihoods of Indigenous Peoples of the north will be altered when ecosystem services associated with changes in biodiversity are affected. Unfortunately, monitoring of biodiversity change in Arctic freshwaters is currently inadequate, making it difficult, if not impossible, to predict changes in ecosystem services. Synthesis and applications. We propose a three-step approach to better address and facilitate monitoring of the rapid ecological changes that Arctic freshwater ecosystems are currently experiencing as a result of climate change. First, we should increase our efforts in the monitoring of freshwaters across all Arctic countries by setting up a network of monitoring sites and devoting more effort to a broad-scale baseline survey using standardized methods. Second, we should enhance modelling efforts to include both ecological change and socio-economic development. These models should help pinpoint species, ecosystems and geographical areas that are likely to show abrupt changes in response to any changes. Third, we should increase interaction among scientists, policymakers and different stakeholder groups. In particular, Indigenous Peoples must be involved in the leadership, planning and execution of monitoring and assessment activities of Arctic freshwaters. The proposed approach, which is critical to detecting the effects of climate change in the circumpolar region, has broader applications for global coordination of Arctic freshwater biomonitoring. Through routine monitoring, standardization of methods, enhanced modelling of integrated scientific and socio-economic change, and increased collaboration within and among sectors, more effective monitoring and management of climate change impacts on freshwater biodiversity will be possible in the Arctic and globally.",,,,"Heino, Jani/E-6342-2010","Heino, Jani/0000-0003-1235-6613; Lento, Jennifer/0000-0002-8098-4825",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,JUL,2020,57,7,,,,,1192,1198,,10.1111/1365-2664.13645,,JUN 2020,,,,,WOS:000538574600001,,,,,,

Its natural distribution spans across Europe, but seeds have also been transferred between countries, mixing plants of different genetic origins. In Denmark, Scotch broom consists of two gene pools: one is found in relatively small populations and is considered native; the other one is presumably introduced and is spreading as a noxious weed. To assess climate thresholds controlling the geographic ranges of the two gene pools, we evaluated seasonal changes in freezing tolerance (electrolyte leakage) and underlying variations in carbohydrate metabolism (HPLC) and water status of genetically different source populations representing the two gene pools. The data reveal that the introduced type is less freezing tolerant than the native type with differences being greatest in early autumn and when plants are most cold hardy, lending support to the hypothesis that insufficient freezing tolerance currently limits range expansion of the introduced Danish Scotch broom. In both gene pools, parallel increases in freezing tolerance and concentrations of sucrose and raffinose and decreasing levels of starch indicate the mobilization of soluble sugars from storage carbohydrates to achieve maximum freezing tolerance. However, genotypic differences in freezing tolerance are not explained by differences in carbohydrate metabolism, but may be related to different water contents.

The original native host plants of these moths have not been confirmed. This study investigated the performance (survival, development time, weight gain) of three Wiseana species on seven putative host plants: five native and two exotic species. The aim was to identify native hosts for the three Wiseana species and to compare their performance on native plants and exotic pasture plants. The chemical composition of the seven putative host plants was investigated to compare native and exotic plant chemistries, and to test for associations between plant characteristics and performance of selected Wiseana species. Carbon, nitrogen, silica and fibre contents were measured for each plant species; primary metabolite composition was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. For the three moth species, increased survival and weight gain were significantly associated with high nitrogen and low fibre contents in one exotic host plant, white clover (Trifolium repens), although one species, W. umbraculata, did not complete development to adult on any of the plants tested, including clover. Two exotic plants (T. repens, Lolium perenne x Lolium multiflorum), and two native plants (Aciphylla squarrosa and Festuca actae) supported W. copularis development to the adult stage, but only one exotic (T. repens) and one native (F. actae) species supported complete development of W. cervinata. Exotic and native plant species had distinct metabolite profiles, but there was no significant association between metabolite composition and Wiseana performance. We conclude that W. copularis and W. cervinata, but not W. umbraculata, have expanded their host range, because of their ability to use both native and new hosts.

Using a mixture of analytic and numerical methods, we show that individual variation in dispersal rates increases spread rates and the more heritable this variation, the greater the increase. In contrast, individual variation in lifetime fecundity only increases spread rates when some of this variation is heritable. The highest increases in spread rates occur when variation in dispersal positively co-varies with fecundity.

This pattern has been generally interpreted as a signature of ongoing episodes of positive selection, or as evidence for a mis-assignment of ancestral/derived allelic states, but uSFS has also been observed in populations receiving gene flow from a ghost population, in structured populations, or after range expansions. In order to better explain the prevalence of high-frequency variants in humans and other populations, we describe here which patterns of gene flow and population demography can lead to uSFS by using extensive coalescent simulations. We find that uSFS can often be observed in a population if gene flow brings a few ancestral alleles from a well-differentiated population. Gene flow can either consist in single pulses of admixture or continuous immigration, but different demographic conditions are necessary to observe uSFS in these two scenarios. Indeed, an extremely low and recent gene flow is required in the case of single admixture events, while with continuous immigration, uSFS occurs only if gene flow started recently at a high rate or if it lasted for a long time at a low rate. Overall, we find that a neutral uSFS occurs under more restrictive conditions in populations having received single pulses of gene flow than in populations exposed to continuous gene flow. We also show that the uSFS observed in human populations from the 1000 Genomes Project can easily be explained by gene flow from surrounding populations without requiring past episodes of positive selection. These results imply that uSFS should be common in non-isolated populations, such as most wild or domesticated plants and animals.",,,,"Marchi, Nina/Q-5148-2016; Excoffier, Laurent/D-3498-2013","Marchi, Nina/0000-0001-6624-5922; Excoffier, Laurent/0000-0002-7507-6494",,,,,,,,,,,,1752-4571,,,,,OCT,2020,13,9,,,,,2254,2263,,10.1111/eva.12998,,JUN 2020,,,,,WOS:000536946300001,33005222,,,,,

Incomplete and inaccurate data on habitat associations and current species distributions pose a barrier to effective conservation and management for several species of endemic sea snakes in Western Australia that are thought to be in decline. Here we used a correlative modelling approach to understand habitat associations and identify suitable habitats for five of these species (Aipysurus apraefrontalis, A. foliosquama, A. fuscus, A. l. pooleorum and A. tenuis). We modelled species-specific habitat suitability across 804,244 km(2) of coastal waters along the North-west Shelf of Western Australia, to prioritise future survey regions to locate unknown populations of these rare species. Model projections were also used to quantify the effectiveness of current spatial management strategies (Marine Protected Areas) in conserving important habitats for these species. Species-specific models matched well with the records on which they were trained, and identified additional regions of suitability without records. Subsequent field validation of the model projections uncovered a previously unknown locality for A. fuscus within the mid-shelf shoal region, outside its currently recognised global range.

Analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences was combined with ecological niche modelling (ENM) to infer the demographic and population differentiation scenarios under present and past conditions. Analyses of 108 samples from 11 geographic locations revealed population structure and genetic differentiation among populations separated by the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (IT) and the Motagua-Polochic-Jocotan (MPJ) fault barriers. ENM predicted a widespread distribution of suitable habitat for H. leucotis since the Last Inter Glacial (LIG), but this habitat noticeably contracted and fragmented at the IT. Models for historical dispersal corridors based on population genetics data and ENM revealed the existence of corridors among populations west of the IT; however, the connectivity of populations across the IT has changed little since the LIG. The shallow geographic structure on either side of the isthmus and a star-like haplotype network, combined with the long-term persistence of populations across time based on genetic data and potential dispersal routes, support a scenario of divergence with migration and subsequent isolation and differentiation in Chiapas and south of the MPJ fault.

However, the specific environmental and population genetics processes causing this gradient were not formally investigated and promoted discussion in recent studies. Here we studied the influence of diverse environmental and population genetics processes on Asian genetic gradients and identified which could have produced the observed gradient. To do so, we performed extensive spatially-explicit computer simulations of genetic data under the following scenarios: (a) variable levels of admixture between Paleolithic and Neolithic populations, (b) migration through long-distance dispersal (LDD), (c) Paleolithic range contraction induced by the last glacial maximum (LGM), and (d) Neolithic range expansions from one or two geographic origins (the Fertile Crescent and the Yangzi and Yellow River Basins). Next, we estimated genetic gradients from the simulated data and we found that they were sensible to the analysed processes, especially to the range contraction induced by LGM and to the number of Neolithic expansions.

North American woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations suffer from habitat modifications and most are currently in decline. It has been suggested that the conversion of old-growth coniferous forests into early-seral stages has increased cervid abundances, which have, in turn, stimulated a numerical response of predator populations, ultimately threatening caribou populations via a habitat-mediated apparent competition mechanism. Using a long-term dataset (1984-2012) of the Atlantic-Gaspesie caribou population, we quantified changes in interspecific interactions triggered by apparent competition between moose (Alces americanus) and caribou via the responses of two incidental predators, coyote (Canis latrans) and black bear (Ursus americanus). We also documented calf recruitment rates and analysed temporal trends (last three decades) in this vital rate. Inter-annual variations in autumn calf recruitment were mostly affected by the proxy of regional abundance of coyotes, which was highly correlated with moose and black bear proxies of abundance. The increase in coyote abundance proxy in the Gaspesie Peninsula following anthropogenic habitat modifications seems to be the main mechanism responsible for the current decline in the Atlantic-Gaspesie caribou population. Our analyses revealed some impacts of habitat alteration and the complexity of the resulting trophic cascades. (C) 2020 The Authors.

This study is based on a hydrobiological survey of the Don River Basin conducted in August 2011 and reflects a period when three new Caspian invaders (Dikerogammarus caspius, Adacna glabra, and Theodoxus major) were already widely distributed in the study area. At the time of the expedition, of all the invasive species present, these three caused the greatest impact on local species and communities in the Don Basin. The greatest biological contamination was found in areas which had already had relatively favorable conditions for existing resident Ponto-Caspian communities. In contrast, those stations devoid of invaders were those under the most severe anthropogenic pressure or subject to estuarine conditions. This pattern was confirmed by biocontamination indices being significantly correlated with standard water quality indices. The situation in the studied area, involving both the Azov-Caspian exchange via the Volga-Don Canal and the eastward invasion of exotic species, such as Ferrissia californica and Potamopyrgus antipodarum, clearly identifies a single Ponto-Caspian Invasion Corridor that connects all three marine basins of the Ponto-Caspian region.

In coastal wetlands, mangroves in temperate-tropical ecotones are encroaching on adjacent saltmarshes, a pattern that is primarily attributed to warmer winter temperatures. Climate change is also expected to increase the vulnerability of coastal wetlands to eutrophication, and increases in nutrient availability may further mediate the rate of mangrove expansion. We investigated the consequences of nutrient enrichment on coastal wetlands in the mangrove-saltmarsh ecotone near the temperate edge of mangrove distribution along the northeast coast of Florida. We tested the hypothesis that nutrient enrichment enhances the ongoing, climate-driven expansion of mangroves into areas historically dominated by saltmarshes by increasing mangrove growth and cover, allowing them to outcompete and overgrow adjacent saltmarsh plants. We manipulated nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability and measured the effects on growth, cover, diversity, leaf traits, and nutrient dynamics of Avicennia germinans. We found that A. germinans shrubs growing in the saltmarsh-mangrove ecotone in northern Florida grew taller, increased their canopies, and had higher reproductive output when enriched with N compared to control plants and P-enriched plants. Nutrient enrichment did not alter Sarcocornia perennis growth and increased Batis maritima height but did not alter density or biomass. Nitrogen addition caused an increase in A. germinans cover and decrease in B. maritima cover and Simpson's index of diversity, suggesting that N enrichment, an ongoing phenomenon, can hasten the invasion of mangroves into saltmarshes by favoring mangrove growth and reproduction without significantly enhancing saltmarsh plant growth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1432-9840,1435-0629,,,,JUN,2020,23,4,,,,,703,714,,10.1007/s10021-019-00441-2,,,,,,,WOS:000536735200001,,,,,,

Methods We used a hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) to combine multiple scales, sources, qualities and types of species data. We jointly examined the climate influence on occupancy across scales, and on juvenile and adult abundance to quantify habitat quality at two life history stages. Results We found that cold temperature was the strongest predictor of whitebark pine occurrence at regional scales, with colder areas being better (i.e. the sign was negative). Occupancy at local scales was best predicted by low growing degree-days and declining precipitation as snow. These relationships with occupancy across scales indicate that suitable climatic and topographic habitats currently exist beyond the northern edge of whitebark pine's current range. We found high adult abundance was predicted in sunny, cool habitats with little climatic drought, whereas high juvenile densities were associated with higher precipitation as snow and more climatic drought. Main conclusions The negative relationship to temperature and the ample suitable habitats predicted to exist poleward of the current species' range limit indicates whitebark pine is not limited by cold temperatures.

Anthropogenic climate-change compounds negative effects of land-use change on forest persistence and forest-dependent biodiversity. Habitat loss and climate change have an additive effect and drive species' extinctions in similar ways, resulting in a homogenization of biodiversity. Connectivity is key in conservation planning for mitigating climate change effects and facilitating species' abilities to disperse throughout remnant habitat and track their climate niches. We used three forest-specialized and habitat-specific bird species as focal species to understand avian connectivity and conservation of each of South Africa's three threatened forest classes, as each species is range-restricted to its respective forest type. Location South Africa. Methods We created ensemble models of species' distributions and combined core home- and breeding-range patches with a hybrid of least-cost pathways and ecological circuit theory linkages to assess the success of corridors in facilitating connectivity of each of the three forest types. We then predicted the likelihood of niche persistence for each species under future climate-change scenarios, and the efficacy of our connectivity modelling to facilitate range expansion or climate-niche tracking. Results The projected habitat loss under climate-change scenarios impacted core-habitat patch distribution, size and connectivity, exacerbated habitat fragmentation and increased resistance and the severity of pinch points and barriers along dispersal corridors. Forest systems and associated focal species projected to experience the highest levels of habitat loss/contraction occurred at mid- to high elevations. Climate-change resilience across ecosystems, and persistence of species therein, was dependent on connectivity, facilitating species' ability to track specific climate niches.

We used 10 yr (2009-2018) of data from commercial fisheries and a bather protection program along the coast of New South Wales (NSW), southeastern Australia, to investigate (1) spatial and temporal patterns of occurrence in bull sharks and (2) environmental factors affecting bull shark occurrence along the coast of NSW. Predicted future distribution for this species was modelled for the forecast strengthening East Australian Current. Bull sharks were mostly harvested in small to larger estuaries, with average depth and rainfall responsible for contrasting patterns for each of the fisheries. There was an increase in the occurrence of bull sharks over the last decade, particularly among coastal setline fisheries, associated with seasonal availability of thermal gradients >22 degrees C and both westward and southward coastal currents stronger than 0.15 and 0.60 m s(-1), respectively, during the austral summer. Our model predicts a 3 mo increase in the availability of favourable water temperatures along the entire coast of NSW for bull sharks by 2030. This coast-line provides a uniquely favourable topography for range expansion in the face of a southerly shift of warmer waters, and habitat is unlikely to be a limiting factor for bull sharks in the future.

However, growing evidence indicates the importance of cryptic refugia for northern colonization dynamics. An important geographic region to assess this is Fennoscandia, where recolonization at the end of the last glaciation was restricted to specific routes and temporal windows. We used genomic data to analyse genetic diversity and colonization history of the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) throughout Europe (>800 samples) with Fennoscandia as the northern apex. We inferred that bank voles colonized Fennoscandia multiple times by two different routes; with three separate colonizations via a southern land-bridge route deriving from a Carpathian glacial refugium and one via a north-eastern route from an Eastern glacial refugium near the Ural Mountains. Clustering of genome-wide SNPs revealed high diversity in Fennoscandia, with eight genomic clusters: three of Carpathian origin and five Eastern. Time estimates revealed that the first of the Carpathian colonizations occurred before the Younger Dryas (YD), meaning that the first colonists survived the YD in Fennoscandia. Results also indicated that introgression between bank and northern red-backed voles (Myodes rutilus) took place in Fennoscandia just after end-glacial colonization. Therefore, multiple colonizations from the same and different cryptic refugia, temporal and spatial separations and interspecific introgression have shaped bank vole genetic variability in Fennoscandia.

Spatial sorting theory advances that invasive species can spread via a selection-neutral process predicated on differential movement. In addition to morphology and physiology, it has been predicted that variation in exploration and activity among individuals can be crucial to this model because these behaviors enhance movement. We aimed to address the question of whether exploration and activity are associated with invasive spread using the free-ranging invasive common myna (Acridotheres tristis) in Australia, one of the most broadly distributed invasive birds globally. We radio-tracked mynas from invasion-front sites versus long-established sites in New South Wales. We quantified activity using frequent movements in familiar areas and exploration using infrequent long-distance excursive movements, while also accounting for environmental variation. We discovered that mean daily distance travelled was larger in invasion-front than in invasion-source mynas, suggesting front mynas were more active. Invasion front mynas had significantly larger exploratory home ranges, moved greater maximum daily distances, and changed roost more frequently, suggesting front mynas were also more exploratory; the results were maintained when climate was included as a covariate. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show enhanced exploration and activity in free-ranging invasion-front birds. Inter-individual variation in movement-relevant behaviors might be facilitating the ongoing Australian myna range expansion, although habitat effects cannot be fully excluded.

We collected specimens from 16 sites encompassing the entire range of the species and analyzed hypervariable fragments of the 18S SSU rDNA marker. We identified six hierarchically organized genotypes with mutually exclusive distribution organized along a longitudinal gradient. The distribution is consistent with diversification occurring in the Indo-West Pacific (IWP) followed by dispersal toward the periphery. This pattern can be explained by: (a) high dispersal capacity of the species, (b) habitat heterogeneity driving more recent differentiation in the IWP, and (c) ecological-scale processes such as niche incumbency reinforcing patterns of genotype mutual exclusion. The dispersal potential of this species drives the ongoing range expansion into the Mediterranean Sea, indicating that A. lobifera is able to expand its distribution by tracking increases in temperature. The genetic structure reveals recent diversification and high rate of extinction in the evolutionary history of the clade suggesting a high turnover rate of the diversity at the cryptic level.

Study sites diverged into four regions (Eastern Canada; Central and Western Canada and Alaska; Siberia; and Western Eurasia) based on their climate history, although all were characterized by similar qualitative patterns of behaviour (with about half of the sites showing advancing behaviour). The main associations between climate trend variables and behaviour indicate the importance of precipitation rather than temperature for both qualitative and quantitative behaviours, and the importance of non-growing season as well as growing season months. Poleward latitudinal advance rates differed significantly among regions, being smallest in Eastern Canada (similar to 10 m/year) and largest in Western Eurasia (similar to 100 m/year). These rates were 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than expected if vegetation distribution remained in equilibrium with climate. The many biotic and abiotic factors influencing FTE behaviour make poleward advance rates matching predicted 21st century CCVs (similar to 10(3)-10(4) m/year) unlikely. The lack of empirical evidence for swift forest relocation and the discrepancy between CCV and FTE response contradict equilibrium model-based assumptions and warrant caution when assessing global-change-related biotic and abiotic implications, including land-atmosphere feedbacks and carbon sequestration.",,,,"Mamet, Steven Douglas/H-8408-2019; Rees, William Gareth/AAM-9701-2020; Swirad, Zuzanna M./Q-6983-2018; Cairns, David/F-3395-2014; Tutubalina, Olga/G-2008-2011","Mamet, Steven Douglas/0000-0002-3510-3814; Rees, William Gareth/0000-0001-6020-1232; Swirad, Zuzanna M./0000-0002-3592-9739; Cairns, David/0000-0003-4110-196X; Harper, Karen/0000-0001-5390-0262; Tutubalina, Olga/0000-0001-8049-1724",,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,JUL,2020,26,7,,,,,3965,3977,,10.1111/gcb.15113,,MAY 2020,,,,,WOS:000531067400001,32281711,,,,,

Because migration involves movement, most hypotheses about the relationship between migration and range size invoke an influence of migration on the process of dispersal-mediated range expansion. Intuitively, a positive relationship between migratory behavior and dispersal ability could bolster range expansion among migratory species, yet some biogeographic patterns suggest that long-distance migration may instead impede range expansion, especially in the temperate zone. We conducted a comparative analysis of the relationship between migratory behavior and range size by testing the effect of migratory status, migration distance and morphological dispersal ability on breeding range size among all temperate North American passerines. Further, we assessed whether these traits affect range expansion into suitable habitat by analyzing their relationship with range filling (the proportion of climatically-suitable area occupied, or 'filled' by a species). Contrary to previous studies, we found migration and dispersal ability to be poor predictors of range size and range filling in North America. Rather, most variation in range size is explained by latitude. Our results suggest that migratory behavior does not affect range size within the scale of a continent, and furthermore, that temperate North American passerines' breeding ranges are not influenced by their dispersal abilities. To better understand why migratory behavior appears to promote range size in some contexts and constrain it in others, future studies should investigate how migratory behavior affects dispersal at the individual level, as well as the relationship between the evolution of migratory behavior and the breadth of species' climatic niches.",,,,"Pegan, Teresa/AAF-8612-2021",,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,,,AUG,2020,43,8,,,,,1191,1202,,10.1111/ecog.05070,,MAY 2020,,,,,WOS:000530878900001,,,,,,

The distribution of plants at the scale of continents broadly conforms to the climatological regimes at play; however, in scaling down to the regional and landscape context, the influence of climate becomes confounded by complex and interacting biotic and abiotic factors. These factors have often been cited as important variables in determining the locations of biome overlap, including the boreal forest-temperate forest ecotone (BTE). The BTE exists as a broad latitudinal swath between the boreal and temperate forest biomes in the eastern half of North America. While the impact of non-climatic factors on the location of the BTE has been investigated within the ecotone, few studies focus on how these same factors are shaping the colonization of the southern boreal forest by northern temperate tree species as part of a potential northward shift of the BTE. The effects of seed and seedling herbivory, substrate composition, microclimate, and canopy composition on seedling emergence of four northern temperate tree species were investigated in a beyond-range seeding experiment spanning the southern portion of the island of Newfoundland, Canada. To represent a range of temperate tree reproductive strategies, we examined two small-seeded tree species, Betula alleghaniensis and Thuja occidentalis, and two tree species with large seeds relative to typical boreal forest species, Acer saccharum and Fraxinus nigra. The results of this experiment show a reproductive strategy-dependent emergence response; large seeds and seedlings appear more vulnerable to predation, while small seeds are more vulnerable to smothering by leaf litter. Canopies with greater representation of deciduous species posed a significant barrier to small seeds that produce small seedlings, while the food-rich reward of the larger seeds made for attractive targets to granivorous vertebrates. This work represents a rare glimpse at the challenges northern temperate tree species will face if they are to colonize the southern boreal forest and track changing climates as is broadly expected.",,,,,"Crofts, Anna/0000-0002-0098-1844",,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,MAY,2020,11,5,,,,,,,e03108,10.1002/ecs2.3108,,,,,,,WOS:000538094900009,,,,,,

However, few studies have explicitly considered the combined influence of urbanization and climate on species expansion. We investigated the combined roles of climate, urbanization and human-mediated dispersal in the expansion of Tetramorium immigrans (an invasive pavement ant in North America) in urban areas of South-eastern France. A total of 544 T. immigrans individuals were sampled from 16 urban gradients and genotyped at 14 microsatellite markers. Based on molecular ecology methods and statistical modelling, we evaluated the impact of climate and urbanization on its distribution patterns. Through the combined study of the occurrence probabilities of T. immigrans, its genetic structure and the founder effects within its populations, the effect of climateurbanization interaction on species distribution was clearly evidenced, suggesting that in the north of its range, T. immigrans subsists under harsher climate by colonizing the most urbanized areas. Many taxa may conform to such pattern, making the combined study of climate and urbanization a necessary challenge for future studies. Distribution patterns concurred with similar observations in the American invasive range of T. immigrans, making it likely that it may not be native to the northernmost part of its European range. Cryptic invasions or discreet range shifts in response to increasing urbanization are likely to occur in many taxa, especially in ants, and deserve increased attention from researchers and managers alike.

Ultimately, a new vision and new rules are called for but in the meantime wildlife lawyers and other conservation professionals must work with conventional legal frameworks. Striking instances where vexing issues arise are the recent range expansions of certain canids. Coyotes Canis latrans and crab-eating foxes Cerdocyon thous in the Americas and golden jackals Canis aureus in Europe are progressively colonizing areas and countries where they did not previously occur. A key question is whether to consider this as acceptable extensions of natural range or whether the pioneering carnivores should be viewed as alien species, potentially triggering legal obligations of prevention, control and eradication. In addressing this question we draw on guidance provided under the Convention on Biological Diversity and other international legal frameworks, in which governments are forced to grapple with the application of long-standing concepts to new phenomena in an era of profound global change. Our analysis suggests that coyotes in Costa Rica, crab-eating foxes in Panama, and golden jackals in the Netherlands are not to be considered alien species, whether invasive or not.

Location China. Methods We examined genetic structure of 11 populations across China using SNPs, microsatellites and a segment of mitochondrial cox1 gene. ADMIXTURE, STRUCTURE and DAPC were used to infer population genetic structure; the dispersal routes were reconstructed by the DIYABC; SNPs potentially related to climate adaptation were identified by using four populations differentiation methods and three environmental association methods. Results Strong genetic differentiation was found among populations with F-ST values ranging from 0.097 to 0.640 based on SNPs. Populations located at the northern expansion edge exhibited the highest genetic differentiation and the lowest genetic diversity. Demographic analyses indicated that all populations were introduced from a single source population with small effective size and low recent gene flow. RDA analysis showed that climatic variables explained a higher proportion of genetic variance (43%) compared to population structure variables (15%). The top climatic variables associated with genetic differentiation were precipitation of the mean temperature of warmest quarter, mean temperature of driest quarter and isothermality. Genes related to climate candidate SNPs were mainly enriched to pathways of development, energy and xenobiotic metabolisms. Main conclusions We found that extremely rapid and strong population genetic differentiation among populations appears to have developed after introduction in the cotton mealybug.

Results Analyses of comparative DNA sequence data in a phylogenetic context reveal the existence of two major clades of similar species-level diversity and provide support for the monophyletic status of most sampled species.

Using experimental lineages of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, we simulated the initial phase of colonisation to progressively cooler and/or more variable conditions, to investigate how adaptation and phenotypic plasticity contribute to shifts in thermal tolerance during colonisation of novel climates. Results We show that heat and cold tolerance rapidly evolve during the initial stages of adaptation to progressively cooler and more variable climates. The evolved shift in cold tolerance is, however, associated with maladaptive plasticity under the novel conditions, resulting in a pattern of countergradient variation between the ancestral and novel, fluctuating thermal environment. In contrast, lineages exposed to progressively cooler, but constant, temperatures over several generations expressed only beneficial plasticity in cold tolerances and no evolved response. Conclusions We propose that thermal adaptation during a range expansion to novel, more variable climates found at high latitudes and elevations may typically involve genetic compensation arising from maladaptive plasticity in the initial stages of adaptation, and that this form of (countergradient) thermal adaptation may represent an opportunity for more rapid and labile evolutionary change in thermal tolerances than via classic genetic assimilation models for thermal tolerance evolution (i.e., selection on existing reaction norms).

The introduction of European gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar dispar) into North America is a classic example of human-aided invasion that has caused tremendous damage to North American temperate forests. Recently, the even more destructive Asian gypsy moth (mainly L. d. asiatica and L. d. japonica) has been intercepted in North America, mostly transported by cargo ships. To track invasion pathways, we developed a diagnostic panel of 60 DNA loci (55 nuclear and 5 mitochondrial) to characterize worldwide genetic differentiation within L. dispar and its sister species L. umbrosa. Hierarchical analyses supported strong differentiation and recovered five geographic groups that correspond to (1) North America, (2) Europe plus North Africa and Middle East, (3) the Urals, Central Asia, and Russian Siberia, (4) continental East Asia, and (5) the Japanese islands. Interestingly, L. umbrosa was grouped with L. d. japonica, and the introduced North American population exhibits remarkable distinctiveness from contemporary European counterparts. Each geographic group, except for North America, shows additional lower-level structures when analyzed individually, which provided the basis for inference of the origin of invasive specimens.

Quantifying patterns and developing models of spread are central to understanding drivers of invasion and forecasting future invasions. We investigated the utility of models for characterizing and predicting spread of emerald ash borer (EAB), quantified temporal dynamics of spread and identified correlates of county-level invasion risk. We estimated rates and frequency of EAB spread and length of long-distance jumps throughout the contiguous USA from 1997 to 2018 and compared observed patterns with model predictions. A time-to-event model was then developed at the county level to assess the influence of habitat characteristics and propagule pressure on invasion risk. The final model was used to forecast invasion risk across the contiguous USA. Range expansion by EAB accorded well with model predictions. Following the initial establishment phase, range expansion rates were biphasic, shifting to a faster, linear pattern around 2002 and then declining from 2015 onwards. From 2003 onwards, EAB invaded 6-134 new counties per year, including a mean of 14 discrete jumps per year averaging 93 +/- 7 SE km. Risk of spread was positively associated with proximity to previously invaded areas, human population density and densities of ash and non-ash trees in rural forests but negatively associated with temperature. Synthesis and applications. At the regional level, the invasion by emerald ash borer appears to be entering the saturation phase, indicating that most high-risk counties in the eastern USA have been invaded. Even though spread has recently slowed, counties in close proximity to invaded areas and that have high densities of humans and trees are at the greatest risk of becoming invaded. Taken together, our findings provide insight into historical and future dynamics of range expansion by emerald ash borer, which can be used to guide risk assessments for potential invaders capable of frequent long-distance dispersal.",,,,,"Fei, Songlin/0000-0003-2772-0166; Ward, Samuel/0000-0002-3206-4880",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,JUN,2020,57,6,,,,,1020,1030,,10.1111/1365-2664.13613,,APR 2020,,,,,WOS:000525825400001,,,,,,

In laboratory rearing experiments, adult body weight and egg mass size of G. grisescens were smaller on M. aquaticum than on the native host Persicaria lapathifolia (Polygonaceae), suggesting that Polygonaceae are more suitable hosts for G. grisescens than M. aquaticum. On M. aquaticum, the larval survival rate was significantly higher in the Chiba strain collected from M. aquaticum than in the Saga strain originating from Polygonaceae. This raises the possibility that the Chiba strain rapidly adapted to M. aquaticum and improved survival rate on the plant.

However, little is understood about when East Asian Tertiary relict plants diversified, how they responded demographically to past environmental change, and to what extent their current genomic composition (and adaptive capacity) might mitigate the effects of global warming. Here, we obtained genomic (RAD-SNP) data for 171 samples from two extant species of Euptelea in China (24 E. pleiosperma populations) and Japan (11 E. polyandra populations) to elucidate their divergence and demographic histories, genome-wide associations with current environmental variables, and genomic vulnerability to future climate change. Our results indicate that Late Miocene changes in climate and/or sea level promoted species divergence, whereas Late Pliocene uplifting in southwest China likely fostered lineage divergence within E. pleiosperma. Its subsequent range expansion into central/east (CE) China bears genomic signatures of climate-driven selection, yet extant CE populations are predicted to be most vulnerable to future climate change. For E. polyandra, geography was the only significant predictor of genomic variation. Our findings indicate a profound impact of Late Neogene geological and climate change on the evolutionary history of Euptelea, with much stronger signals of local adaptation left in China than in Japan. This study deepens our understanding of the complex evolutionary forces that influence the distribution of genetic variation of Tertiary relict trees, and provides insights into their susceptibility to global change and potential for adaptive responses.

They are primarily maintained by abiotic factors and disturbance regimes that could hinder or promote species range shifts in response to climate change. We evaluated how climate change has affected metacommunity dynamics in two adjacent biomes and across their ecotone by resurveying 106 sites that were originally surveyed for avian diversity in the early 20th century by Joseph Grinnell and colleagues. The Mojave, a warm desert, and the Great Basin, a cold desert, have distinct assemblages and meet along a contiguous, east-west boundary. Both deserts substantially warmed over the past century, but the Mojave dried while the Great Basin became wetter. We examined whether the distinctiveness and composition of desert avifaunas have changed, if species distributions shifted, and how the transition zone impacted turnover patterns. Avifauna change was characterized by (a) reduced occupancy, range contractions, and idiosyncratic species redistributions; (b) degradation of historic community structure, and increased taxonomic and climatic differentiation of the species inhabiting the two deserts; and (c) high levels of turnover at the transition zone but little range expansion of species from the warm, dry Mojave into the cooler, wetter Great Basin. Although both deserts now support more drier and warmer tolerant species, their bird communities still occupy distinct climatological space and differ significantly in climatic composition.

In this study, we investigate the impact of repeated disconnection and reconnection of rivers on the population genetics and morphological variation of C. nalbanti.

We examined multi-locus genetic data including a mitochondrial gene, seven nuclear genes and eight microsatellite loci, and scrutinized 31 morphological variables based on 26 morphometric and 3 meristic characters. We uncovered a population genetic structure and noticeable morphological variation among populations approximately corresponding to the geography of river basins along the Yellow Sea. Overall genetic diversity was significantly reduced in the more northern populations, suggesting range expansion from ancestral southern populations into northern rivers via the paleo-Yellow River system in the Yellow Sea during glacial periods of lowered sea levels. A northward range expansion hypothesis was strongly supported by the reconstruction of geographic ranges of ancestral species and/or populations based on phylogenetic analyses. Both mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenetic trees revealed a relatively highly divergent lineage of C. nalbanti in the southernmost populations (Tamjin lineage). Noticeable differences in morphological variables between the Tamjin lineage and other lineages of C. nalbanti also suggest potential separate specific status of the former.

In South Africa, 91 alien and 39 cryptic marine and estuarine species, from 17 taxonomic groups, are known. Of these, three are associated with major invasions, including the Pacific mussel, Semimytilus algosus, which has rapidly spread and colonised the lower portions of rocky shores on the west coast. Semimytilus algosus is indigenous to Chile and has been introduced to Namibia. To determine the source and likely mode of introduction of S. algosus, we analysed the population genetic structure of eight populations on the west coast of South Africa and Namibia, as well as three populations in the native Chilean range. Using cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, we collected sequence data from 226 individuals sampled across the 11 localities. We detected no evidence for founder effects, as the South African and Namibian populations had comparable genetic variation to those sampled in Chile, pointing to large effective population sizes and high propagule pressure in the region. It is probable that the Namibian population originated from Chile, and that introduction took place from there to South Africa via a single and substantial natural larval dispersal that breached the biogeographic barrier created by the Luderitz upwelling cell; but we cannot discount the possibility that introduction associated with oyster aquaculture played a role. Based on comparisons with Mytilus galloprovincialis, we predict S. algosus will continue to spread in South Africa but will be confined to temperate regions; reduce limpet abundance by monopolising primary substratum and because it is too small for them to occupy its shells; and supplement food sources for predators such as oystercatchers and dogwhelks.",,,,"Pillay, Deena/G-6449-2011","Zeeman, Zanne/0000-0001-5088-0358",,,,,,,,,,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,,,JUL,2020,22,7,,,,,2309,2323,,10.1007/s10530-020-02257-x,,APR 2020,,,,,WOS:000523094000001,,,,,,

Population differentiation in the timing of life history events in response to climate gradients is thought to be an important mechanism facilitating the range expansion of many invasive species. For seed producing plants, the timing of seed germination determines the first environmental conditions experienced by newly emerged germinates, and can have important implications for the successful colonization, establishment and spread of invasive plants though the role of germination in the success of invasive plants remains poorly understood. Methods We assessed the variation in seed germination dynamics among 10 populations of the invasive plant Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense) across its North American distribution, capturing both a temperature and precipitation gradient, and whether that variation is associated with home climate. Seeds were exposed to a wide range of temperatures (11-48 degrees C) and two water availability treatments. Important Findings We found that Johnsongrass seeds germinated across a wide range of temperatures, but there was substantial variation among populations in the proportion of seeds that germinated in response to both temperature and water availability. Evidence indicates that as Johnsongrass expanded its range from warmer climates into cooler climates, there was a concurrent shift in the germination temperature niche to cooler temperatures. Our results suggest that the germination of Johnsongrass seeds has adapted to home climate allowing this invader to maximize germination throughout its range, and that this may be an important contributing factor to its invasion into new environments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1752-9921,1752-993X,,,,APR,2020,13,2,,,,,195,203,,10.1093/jpe/rtz062,,,,,,,WOS:000544726900009,,,,,,

We performed a phylogenetic reconstruction of the 31 sexually-reproducing Antennaria species using a novel target enrichment method that employs custom capture probes designed to work across Asteraceae. Both concatenated and coalescent-based analyses of DNA sequence data from hundreds of nuclear loci recovered Antennaria as a monophyletic group except for the long-disputed species, Antennaria linearifolia, which was recovered outside of the genus.

Knowledge gaps in range expansion of alien species can be overcome using predictive approaches such as individual based models (IBMs), especially if predictions can be improved through fitting to empirical data, but this can be challenging for models having multiple parameters. We therefore estimated the parameters of a model implemented in the RangeShifter IBM platform by approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) in order to predict the further invasion of a lowland river (Great Ouse, England) by a small-bodied invasive fish (bitterling Rhodeus sericeus). Prior estimates for parameters were obtained from the literature and expert opinion. Model fitting was conducted using a time-series (1983 to 2018) of sampling data at fixed locations and revealed that for 5 of 11 model parameters, the posterior distributions differed markedly from prior assumptions. In particular, sub-adult maximum emigration probability was substantially higher in the posteriors than priors. Simulations of bitterling range expansion predicted that following detection in 1984, their early expansion involved a relatively high population growth rate that stabilised after 5 years. The pattern of bitterling patch occupancy was sigmoidal, with 20% of the catchment occupied after 20 years, increasing to 80% after 30 years. Predictions were then for 95% occupancy after 69 years. The development of this IBM thus successfully simulated the range expansion dynamics of this small-bodied invasive fish, with ABC improving the simulation precision. This combined methodology also highlighted that sub-adult dispersal was more likely to contribute to the rapid colonisation rate than expert opinion suggested.

Location North American temperate zone. Taxon Sparganophilus and Diplocardia. Methods We collected 556 Sparganophilus earthworms from 64 sites spanning 27 degrees of latitude (18.77 degrees-45.90 degrees N), and 165 Diplocardia earthworms from 23 sites (21 degrees, 19.77 degrees-41.20 degrees N).

Results We estimated the number of potential species to be 10 for Sparganophilus and 8 for Diplocardia, respectively, from 526 haplotypes (403 in Sparganophilus and 123 in Diplocardia). Sparganophilus species diversity was higher at mid-latitudes (32 degrees to 40 degrees) due to a preponderance of species with limited geographical distributions, whereas all specimens collected north of 40 degrees belonged to broadly distributed species. Species with limited geographical distributions were more often collected at higher elevations than broadly distributed species in Sparganophilus.

Main Conclusions These results suggest that, in Sparganophilus, species composition at higher latitudes above 40 degrees is derived from range expansion by broadly distributed species from lower latitudes. The high elevation area in the native distribution range of Sparganophilus is limited to the Appalachian Mountains, which ranges above 33 degrees in latitude. The high species diversity of Sparganophilus with limited distributions at mid-latitude (32 degrees-40 degrees) suggests that the headwater regions at the Appalachian Mountains are sites for more frequent speciation.",,,,"Fragoso, Carlos/Q-6805-2018","Fragoso, Carlos/0000-0001-7076-6712; Callaham, Mac/0000-0001-7915-427X",,,,,,,,,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,,,JUN,2020,47,6,,,,,1373,1382,,10.1111/jbi.13826,,MAR 2020,,,,,WOS:000521808200001,,,,,,

Ecological constraints and functional traits explain high mitochondrial genetic diversity between Sicily and the Italian Peninsula,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Populations inhabiting Mediterranean islands often show contrasting genetic lineages, even on islands that were connected to the mainland during glacial maxima. This pattern is generated by forces acting in historical and contemporary times. Understanding these phenomena requires comparative studies integrating genetic structure, functional traits and dispersal constraints. Using as a model the butterfly species living across the Messina strait (3 km wide) separating Sicily from the Italian Peninsula, we aimed to unravel the mechanisms limiting the dispersal of matrilines and generating genetic differentiation across a narrow sea strait. We analysed the mitochondrial COI gene of 84 butterfly species out of 90 documented in Sicily and compared them with populations from the neighbouring southern Italian Peninsula (1,398 sequences) and from the entire Palaearctic region (8,093 sequences). For each species, we regressed 13 functional traits and 2 ecological constraints to dispersal (winds experienced at the strait and climatic suitability) against genetic differentiation between Sicily and Italian Peninsula to understand the factors limiting dispersal. More than a third of the species showed different haplogroups across the strait and most of them also represented endemic haplogroups for this island. One fifth of Sicilian populations (and 32.3% of endemic lineages) had their closest relatives in distant areas, instead of the neighbouring Italian Peninsula, which suggests high relictuality. Haplotype diversity was significantly explained by the length of the flight period, an intrinsic phenology trait, while genetic differentiation was explained by both intrinsic traits (wingspan and degree of generalism) and contemporary local constraints (winds experienced at the strait and climatic suitability). A relatively narrow sea strait can produce considerable differentiation among butterfly matrilines and this phenomenon showed a largely deterministic fingerprint. Because of unfavourable winds, populations of the less dispersive Sicilian butterflies tended to differentiate into endemic variants or to maintain relict populations. Understanding these phenomena required the integration of DNA sequences, species traits and physical constraints for a large taxon at continental scale. Future studies may reveal if the patterns here shown for mitochondrial DNA are also reflected in the nuclear genome or, alternatively, are the product of limited female dispersal.",,,,"Casacci, Luca Pietro/AAA-4295-2020; Cini, Alessandro/A-4156-2009; Menchetti, Mattia/P-1556-2015; Dinca, Vlad Eugen/O-3879-2014; Vila, Roger/A-1817-2012; Voda, Raluca/E-6817-2015","Casacci, Luca Pietro/0000-0003-3083-7357; Cini, Alessandro/0000-0003-0355-2188; Menchetti, Mattia/0000-0002-0707-7495; Bonelli, Simona/0000-0001-5185-8136; Dinca, Vlad Eugen/0000-0003-1791-2148; Vila, Roger/0000-0002-2447-4388; Voda, Raluca/0000-0003-1970-5628",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,SEP,2020,89,9,,,,,2013,2026,,10.1111/1365-2656.13196,,MAR 2020,,,,,WOS:000563697800001,32207150,,,,,

We assessed spatial and temporal occupation of round gobies in four small streams in two systems in south-central Ontario, Canada to determine which habitat variables are the best predictors of round goby density. Two streams are tributaries of Lake Ontario and two are tributaries of the Otonabee River; all of these streams have barriers preventing upstream migration. Occupation and density patterns differed between the systems. In the Lake Ontario system, density was highest near the longitudinal centre of the stream between the mouth and first barrier, and round goby appeared to occupy these streams mainly from spring to fall. In the Otonabee River system, round goby occupied the streams year-round, and the most important factor determining adult density was distance from a barrier to upstream movement, with density highest next to the barriers. Adult density in Lake Ontario tributaries was highest in sites with a high percentage of cobble/boulder and a low percentage of gravel substrate, while substrate was less important in Otonabee River tributaries. Date was the strongest predictor of juvenile density, with density increasing through the sampling period in both systems.

Despite temperature increases across mountainous areas and high latitudes globally, there has been no ubiquitous change in treeline position. The process of range expansion must initially depend on increased recruitment at, or beyond current range limits and recruitment limitations have been hypothesized as a mechanism for the variable response of treeline position to climate warming. We conducted a unique series of observational and experimental studies to quantify early-life stage constraints, from seed production to seedling establishment, on black spruce Picea mariana and tamarack Larix laricina recruitment at a model alpine treeline in Newfoundland, Canada. We found recruitment at treeline to be simultaneously seed and establishment limited. The treeline population produced fewer seeds than the forest population and black spruce seeds produced at treeline were less viable. Tamarack was more seed limited than black spruce where seed viability was low regardless of altitudinal position. Post-dispersal seed predation greatly constrained recruitment across the altitudinal gradient; however, black spruce seeds experienced the lowest levels of invertebrate seed predation on the lichen mat at treeline. If seeds were not consumed, individuals at treeline were establishment limited where germination and seedling establishment was both less abundant and delayed on lichen substrate.

Two of these activities are human mediated transfer of species and contemporary climate change, and both allow previously isolated genotypes to come into contact and hybridize, potentially altering speciation rates. Hybrids have been shown to survive environmental conditions not tolerated by either parent, suggesting that, under some circumstances, hybrids may be able to expand their ranges and perform well under rapidly changing conditions. However, studies assessing how hybridization influences contemporary range shifts are scarce. We performed crosses onPyura herdmaniandPyura stolonifera(Chordata, Tunicata), two closely related marine invertebrate species that are ecologically dominant and can hybridize. These sister species live in sympatry along the coasts of southern Africa, but one has a disjunct distribution that includes northern hemisphere sites. We experimentally assessed the performance of hybrid and parental crosses using different temperature regimes, including temperatures predicted under future climate change scenarios. We found that hybrids showed lower performance than parental crosses at the experimental temperatures, suggesting that hybrids are unlikely to expand their ranges to new environments. In turn, we found that the more widespread species performed better at a wide array of temperatures, indicating that this parental species may cope better with future conditions.

Here, we reconstructed the evolutionary and biogeographic history of Leiogalathea, a genus of circum-tropical deep-sea squat lobsters, in order to compare patterns and processes that have affected shallow-water and deep-sea squat lobster species. We first built a multilocus phylogeny and a calibrated species tree with a relaxed clock using StarBEAST2 to reconstruct evolutionary relationships and divergence times among Leiogalathea species. We used BioGeoBEARS and a DEC model, implemented in RevBayes, to reconstruct ancestral distribution ranges and the biogeographic history of the genus. Our results showed that Leiogalathea is monophyletic and comprises four main lineages; morphological homogeneity is common within and between clades, except in one; the reconstructed ancestral range of the genus is in the Atlantic and Indian oceans (Tethys). They also revealed the divergence of the Atlantic species around 25 million years ago (Ma), intense cladogenesis 15-25 Ma and low levels of speciation over the last 5 million years (Myr). The four Leiogalathea lineages showed similar patterns of speciation: allopatric speciation followed by range expansion and subsequent stasis. Leiogalathea started diversifying during the Oligocene, likely in the Tethyan. The Atlantic lineage then split from its Indo-Pacific sister group due to vicariance driven by closure of the Tethys Seaway. The Atlantic lineage is less speciose compared with the Indo-Pacific lineages, with the Tropical Southwestern Pacific being the current centre of diversity. Leiogalathea diversification coincided with cladogenetic peaks in shallow-water genera, indicating that historical biogeographic events similarly shaped the diversification and distribution of both deep-sea and shallow-water squat lobsters.",,,,"Machordom, Annie/K-1737-2014; Buckley, David/C-6419-2008; Macpherson, Enrique/J-8982-2012","Machordom, Annie/0000-0003-0341-0809; Buckley, David/0000-0002-6514-2208; Macpherson, Enrique/0000-0003-4849-4532",,,,,,,,,,,,0300-3256,1463-6409,,,,MAY,2020,49,3,,,,,340,356,,10.1111/zsc.12414,,MAR 2020,,,,,WOS:000517767300001,,,,,,

Near the tropical-temperate transition zone, warming winter temperatures are expected to facilitate the poleward range expansion of freeze-sensitive tropical organisms. In coastal wetlands of eastern and central North America, freeze-sensitive woody plants (mangroves) are expected to expand northward into regions currently dominated by freeze-tolerant herbaceous salt marsh plants. To advance understanding of mangrove range expansion, there is a need to refine temperature thresholds for mangrove freeze damage, mortality and recovery. 2. We integrated data from 38 sites spread across the mangrove range edge in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts of North America, including data from a regional collaborative network - the Mangrove Migration Network. In 2018, an extreme freeze event affected 60% of these sites, with minimum temperatures ranging from 0 to -7 degrees C. 3. We used temperature and vegetation data from before and after the freeze to quantify temperature thresholds for leaf damage, mortality and biomass recovery of the black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) - the most freeze-tolerant mangrove species in North America. 4. For A. germinans individuals near their northern range limit, our results indicate that temperature thresholds for leaf damage are close to -4 degrees C, but temperature thresholds for mortality are closer to -7 degrees C. Thresholds are expected to be warmer for more southern A. germinans individuals and for the other two common mangrove species in the region (Laguncularia racemosa and Rhizophora mangle). Regenerative buds allowed A. germinans to resprout and recover quickly from above-ground freeze damage. Hence, biomass recovery levels during the first post-freeze growing season were 90%, 78%, 62% and 45% for temperatures of -4, -5, -6 and -7 degrees C, respectively. Due to a combination of vigorous resprouting and new recruitment from propagules, we expect full recovery at most sites within 1-3 years, assuming no further freeze events. 5. Synthesis. To improve predictions of tropical range expansion in response to climate change, there is a need to better understand tropical species' responses to winter temperature extremes. Collectively, our results refine temperature thresholds for A. germinans freeze damage, mortality and recovery, which can improve predictions of mangrove range expansion and coastal wetland ecological transformations in a warming climate.",,,,"Osland, Michael/D-1814-2014","Osland, Michael/0000-0001-9902-8692; Kaplan, David/0000-0002-0103-0928; Armitage, Anna/0000-0003-1563-8026; Langston, Amy/0000-0002-2402-8898; Hughes, A.

Parasitic plants, among many other parasitic organisms, are shifting in their geographic distribution in response to global change, establishing novel interactions with susceptible but previously unexposed host plants. Projections of future species assemblages in increasingly changing environments frequently overlook the strong capacity of these parasites to transform ecological systems, and host switching is considered a mere change of partner with no subsequent impact on ecosystem properties. 2. We explore the ecological consequences of parasite host shifts analysing the growth and reproductive responses of two host trees that share a different interaction-history with the parasitic plant Viscum album: recent in the case of Pinus sylvestris subsp. nevadensis and longstanding in that of Pinus nigra. We quantified growth by measuring primary (bud elongation) and secondary (dendrochronology) tree growth, and reproduction by quantifying cone crops, cone size, seed production, seed weight, seed germination, and emergence success. 3. Pinus nigra registered a minor effect on reproduction but a major reduction in biomass, clearly reflected in lower primary and secondary tree growth, smaller cones and lighter seeds. On the contrary, P. sylvestris subsp. nevadensis underwent a strong decline of its reproductive capacity with no effects on growth, manifested in smaller cone crops, less seed production, and lower germination and emergence success. 4. Synthesis. Mistletoe parasitism unleashes contrasting responses in taxonomically close host species with sharply different consequences for the forest ecosystem. While old hosts tolerate better the effect of parasitism, minimizing the impact on reproduction at the expense of their growth, recent hosts undergo greater effects of parasitism, suffering reproductive collapse with no perceptible loss of growth. We conclude that the increasing phenomenon of parasite host switching is not just a mere change of partner, but a driver of a new ecosystem organization. These results highlight the importance of considering the specific effects of newly established interactions when predicting future species assemblages, as these can trigger different ecological organizations from those we currently know.",,,,"Zamora, Regino/B-3179-2010","Zamora, Regino/0000-0002-5049-9968; Mellado, Ana/0000-0002-5188-3726",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,MAR,2020,108,2,,,,,788,796,,10.1111/1365-2745.13295,,,,,,,WOS:000520163600031,,,,,,

Here, we studied variation in seed size in Centaurea solstitialis, a weed with worldwide distribution. Additionally, we explored how seed size variation affects seedling survival of C. solstitialis under favorable precipitation conditions in Anatolia, an ancestral region, and unfavorable precipitation conditions in Argentina, a non-native region. To that end, we conducted seed collections following dispersal pathways of C. solstitialis in ancestral, expanded, and non-native ranges. Locally, collections followed elevation gradients. Also, we performed a greenhouse experiment with C. solstitialis populations varying in seed size and water additions simulating precipitation patterns in Anatolia and Argentina. Seeds from ancestral populations at low elevation were smaller than those from the rest of study populations. Also, seed size in populations at high elevation in the expanded range, the main source of non-native populations, was similar to that in all, but one non-native population, where seeds exhibited further increase. Increments in seed size thus track range expansion in C. solstitialis. Locally, seed size increased with elevation in all three ranges, suggesting convergent responses to that gradient. Seedlings from larger seeds displayed greater survival than those from smaller seeds only under Argentinean conditions. Consequently, populations with large seeds may have been instrumental for colonizing that non-native region.

Here we analyze the phylogenetic relationships of riparian frogs of the Mantidactylus ambreensis species complex, which is distributed in the north of Madagascar and was originally described from Montagne d'Ambre, an isolated mountain of volcanic origin, currently protected within Montagne d'Ambre National Park (MANP). Data from mitochondrial DNA, and phylogenomic data from FrogCap, a sequence capture method, independently confirm that this species complex is monophyletic within the subgenus Ochthomantis, and identify two main clades within it. These two clades are separated by 5.6-6.8% pairwise distance in the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene and co-occur in MANP, with one distributed at high elevations (940-1375 m a.s.l.) and the other at lower elevations (535-1010 m a.s.l.), but show almost no haplotype sharing in the nuclear RAG1 gene. This occurrence in syntopy without admixture confirms them as independent evolutionary lineages that merit recognition as separate species, and we here refer to them as high-elevation (HE) and low-elevation (LE) lineage; they will warrant taxonomic assessment to confidently assign the name ambreensis to one or the other. Populations of the M. ambreensis complex from elsewhere in northern Madagascar all belong to the LE lineage, although they do occur over a larger elevational range than in Montagne d'Ambre (285-1040 m a.s.l.). Within LE there are several phylogroups (LE1-LE4) of moderately deep divergence (1.5-2.8% in 16S), but phylogroup LE4 that occurs in MANP has a deeply nested phylogenetic position, as recovered separately by mitochondrial and sequence capture datasets. This suggests that HE and LE did not diverge by a local fission of lower and upper populations, but instead arose through a more complex biogeographic scenario. The branching pattern of phylogroups LE1-LE4 shows a clear south-to-north phylogeographic pattern. We derive from these results a testable hypothesis of vicariant speciation that restricted the HE lineage to MANP and the LE candidate species to a climatic refugium further south, with subsequent northwards range expansion and secondary colonization of MANP by LE.

However, limited analysis are available on the effect of climate change on the distribution of birds in India. During recent years the distribution of the Indian Peafowl, (Pavo cristatus), a dryland species was observed to be expanding in Kerala, southern India, a region falling under the humid tropics. A study was conducted to understand the reasons for this expanding distribution, the influence of climatic variables and the future extent of distribution using MaxEnt. A Mean ensemble of five CMIP5 models were used to predict the potential distribution for the period 2050s (2041-2060) and 2070s (2061-2080) under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The study identified that seasonality of temperature and precipitation during the driest quarter will be the major factors which determine the distribution of P. cristatus. The model showed that in current conditions 19.15% of the study area provides a suitable habitat for P. cristatus, whilst future predictions suggest that there may be a range expansion of 41.44% and 55.33% during the 2050s under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. In the 2070s, area of habitat range may decline to 22.09% and 32.22% under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. Comparison of various RCP scenarios showed high habitat suitability under RCP 8.5. Central Kerala is found to be the hotspot for the Indian Peafowl population expansion and the distribution may be prominent towards southeast and northwest during the 2050s and 2070s respectively.

Disturbed areas are typically warmer than adjacent natural habitats (e.g. urban heat island effect), and thus, ectotherms may benefit from landscape modifications. Although much research has considered how urban areas facilitate invasion, greenhouses may enhance successful invasion to rural areas via transport of exotics through plant shipments and increased temperatures. However, for non-native species to establish and become invasive, populations must adapt to the local climate outside the protection of greenhouses. We studied a population of non-native lizards (Anolis sagrei) that have been naturalized for at least 10 years in a greenhouse in Opelika, Alabama, USA, which is far above the northernmost point of the species' continuous invasive range. The greenhouse was warmer than adjacent outdoor habitat at all hours of the day and often reached temperatures above the critical thermal maximum of lizards. Our measurements of behavior and thermal physiology suggest that lizards have not physiologically adapted to these novel conditions, but rather, behavioral modifications likely allow the population to persist. Moreover, we found no evidence that lizards are dispersing from the greenhouse, and we conclude that this population is dependent on this structure for survival. While human structures and human-modified habitats may facilitate the transport of non-natives, these environments potentially shield populations from selective pressures necessary for species to spread throughout non-native areas.

Soil communities could aid the plants' shift into novel areas by harbouring fewer soil-borne antagonists or more mutualists that influence the fitness and stress tolerance of the shifting species. Alternatively, they could contain novel antagonists or fewer mutualists. Thus, soil communities could positively or negatively affect plant range expansion, particularly if they influence plants' responses to climate, such as freeze tolerance, that feedback to affect expansion. We used the northward range expansion of the black mangrove, Avicennia germinans, into a system dominated by marsh cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, in northern Florida, USA to study how the novel soil environment (i.e. S. alterniflora soil) affects mangrove fitness, susceptibility to cold stress and the colonization of mutualist fungi. We quantified abundance of root mutualistic fungi in mixed marsh-mangrove habitat and conducted a laboratory experiment to test effects of steam-sterilized and live soils from A. germinans and S. alterniflora on the growth, condition, fungal colonization and freeze tolerance of A. germinans seedlings. In the field, we found two times higher dark septate endophyte (DSE) colonization of A. germinans roots and three times higher fungal spore density in A. germinans soil compared to S. alterniflora roots and soil. In the laboratory experiment, seedlings in steamed S. alterniflora soil treatments had 50%-65% survival after freezing, compared to 0% survival in treatments with live S. alterniflora soil. A. germinans live soil mixed with S. alterniflora steamed soil yielded A. germinans roots with the highest DSE colonization and seedlings with greater shoot biomass and lower root:shoot ratios. S. alterniflora live soil lowered the freeze tolerance of A. germinans, decreased mangrove survival and depressed DSE colonization. Synthesis. S. alterniflora soil could impede A. germinans establishment in salt marsh communities. As climate warming gradually allows A. germinans to displace S. alterniflora, the rhizosphere could become increasingly hospitable to A. germinans.

However, this regulating service causes warming, acidification and deoxygenation of deep waters, leading to decreased food availability at the seafloor. These changes and their projections are likely to affect productivity, biodiversity and distributions of deep-sea fauna, thereby compromising key ecosystem services. Understanding how climate change can lead to shifts in deep-sea species distributions is critically important in developing management measures. We used environmental niche modelling along with the best available species occurrence data and environmental parameters to model habitat suitability for key cold-water coral and commercially important deep-sea fish species under present-day (1951-2000) environmental conditions and to project changes under severe, high emissions future (2081-2100) climate projections (RCP8.5 scenario) for the North Atlantic Ocean. Our models projected a decrease of 28%-100% in suitable habitat for cold-water corals and a shift in suitable habitat for deep-sea fishes of 2.0 degrees-9.9 degrees towards higher latitudes. The largest reductions in suitable habitat were projected for the scleractinian coral Lophelia pertusa and the octocoral Paragorgia arborea, with declines of at least 79% and 99% respectively. We projected the expansion of suitable habitat by 2100 only for the fishes Helicolenus dactylopterus and Sebastes mentella (20%-30%), mostly through northern latitudinal range expansion. Our results projected limited climate refugia locations in the North Atlantic by 2100 for scleractinian corals (30%-42% of present-day suitable habitat), even smaller refugia locations for the octocorals Acanella arbuscula and Acanthogorgia armata (6%-14%), and almost no refugia for P. arborea.

Hippos in Africa fertilize lakes and rivers by grazing on land and excreting wastes in the water. Stable isotopes indicate that terrestrial sources contribute more carbon in Colombian lakes containing hippo populations, and daily dissolved oxygen cycles suggest that their presence stimulates ecosystem metabolism. Phytoplankton communities were more dominated by cyanobacteria in lakes with hippos, and bacteria, zooplankton, and benthic invertebrate communities were similar regardless of hippo presence.

J,"Shaw, AK",,,,"Shaw, Allison K.",,,Causes and consequences of individual variation in animal movement,MOVEMENT ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Animal movement comes in a variety of 'types' including small foraging movements, larger one-way dispersive movements, seasonally-predictable round-trip migratory movements, and erratic nomadic movements. Although most individuals move at some point throughout their lives, movement patterns can vary widely across individuals within the same species: differing within an individual over time (intra-individual), among individuals in the same population (inter-individual), or among populations (inter-population). Yet, studies of movement (theoretical and empirical alike) more often focus on understanding 'typical' movement patterns than understanding variation in movement. Here, I synthesize current knowledge of movement variation (drawing parallels across species and movement types), describing the causes (what factors contribute to individual variation), patterns (what movement variation looks like), consequences (why variation matters), maintenance (why variation persists), implications (for management and conservation), and finally gaps (what pieces we are currently missing). By synthesizing across scales of variation, I span across work on plasticity, personality, and geographic variation. Individual movement can be driven by factors that act at the individual, population, community and ecosystem level and have ramifications at each of these levels. Generally the consequences of movement are less well understood than the causes, in part because the effects of movement variation are often nested, with variation manifesting at the population level, which in turn affects communities and ecosystems. Understanding both cause and consequence is particularly important for predicting when variation begets variation in a positive feedback loop, versus when a negative feedback causes variation to be dampened successively. Finally, maintaining standing variation in movement may be important for facilitating species' ability to respond to future environmental change.",,,,"Shaw, Allison K/E-7161-2010","Shaw, Allison K/0000-0001-7969-8365",,,,,,,,,,,,2051-3933,,,,,FEB 17,2020,8,1,,,,,,,12,10.1186/s40462-020-0197-x,,,,,,,WOS:000517126200001,32099656,,,,,

Our study species, Drosophila montana, represents the northern insect species where flies enter reproductive diapause under short day conditions and where the precise timing of diapause is crucial for both survival and offspring production. We have studied clinal variation in the critical day length for female diapause induction (CDL) and their overall susceptibility to enter diapause (diapause incidence), as well as the temperature sensitivity of these traits. The study was performed using multiple strains from four latitudinal clines of the species - short clines in Finland and Alaska and long clines in the Rocky Mountains and the western coast of North America - and from one population in Kamchatka, Russia. CDL showed strong latitudinal clines on both continents, decreasing by one hour per five degrees decline in latitude, on average. CDL also decreased in all populations along with an increase in fly rearing temperature postponing the diapause to later calendar time, the effects of temperature being stronger in southern than in northern population. Female diapause incidence was close to 100% under short day/low temperature conditions in all populations, but decreased below 50% even under short days in 19 degrees C in the southern North American western coast populations and in 22 degrees C in most populations. Comparing a diversity of climatic data for the studied populations showed that while CDL is under a tight photoperiodic regulation linked with latitude, its length depends also on climatic factors determining the growing season length.

If continuously inhabited over several of the Quaternary glacial cycles, the refugia are readily identifiable by the accumulated genetic diversity. However, the sources of the Holocene range expansion, particularly important for the emergence of present-day bio- and phylogeographic patterns and for realistic estimation of species' expansion rates, might have been located at the fringes of the glacial species ranges and lack unique lineages. This problem is pertinent when the variation is explored at slowly evolving genetic markers. We suggest that the location of such source refugia may be approximated by reconstructing the geographic location as a continuous trait evolving along the branches of a phylogenetic tree. We applied this approach, using the BEAST software, on two large southeast European land snail species: Caucasotachea vindobonensis and Helix thessalica. We found evidence for C. vindobonensis refugia in the western Balkans; notable is an apparently old refugium in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The plausible sources of the species' Holocene range expansion, however, were located around the south-western end of the Carpathians. Although the source areas were likely similar in H. thessalica, some expansion sources suggested by the analyses (e.g., Podolia, Ukraine) appeared implausible and driven by sampling clustered in that area.

We examined foraging niche variations of the slender-billed gull (Chroicocephalus genei), a nomadic colonial waterbird species during its range expansion along the French Mediterranean coast over a 16-year period (1998-2013). We investigated whether range expansion was associated with a change in chick diet, breeding success, and chicks body condition. We also examined whether breeding success and chicks body condition were explained by diet and colonial characteristics (number of pairs, laying phenology, habitat, and locality). Diet was characterized using dual-stable isotopic proxies (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of feather keratin from 331 individuals subsampled from a total of 4,154 chicks ringed and measured at 18 different colonies. delta C-13 decreased and delta N-15 increased significantly during range expansion suggesting that chicks were fed from preys of increasing trophic level found in the less salty habitat colonized by the end of the study period. Niche shift occurred without significant change of niche width which did not vary among periods, habitats, or localities either. Breeding success and chick body condition showed no consistent trends over years. Breeding success tended to increase with decreasing delta C-13 at the colony level while there was no relationship between stable isotope signatures and chick body condition. Overall, our results suggest that even if range expansion is associated with foraging niche shift toward the colonization of less salty and more brackish habitats, the shift had marginal effect on the breeding parameters of the Slender-billed gull.

The effective conservation and sustainable use of A. saman requires detailed knowledge of its genetic diversity across its native distribution range of which surprisingly little is known to date. We assessed the genetic diversity and structure of A.saman across twelve representative locations of SDTF in Colombia, and how they may have been shaped by past climatic changes and human influence. We found four different genetic groups which may be the result of differentiation due to isolation of populations in preglacial times. The current distribution and mixture of genetic groups across STDF fragments we observed might be the result of range expansion of SDTFs during the last glacial period followed by range contraction during the Holocene and human-influenced movement of germplasm associated with cattle ranching. Despite the fragmented state of the presumed natural A. saman stands we sampled, we did not find any signs of inbreeding, suggesting that gene flow is not jeopardized in humanized landscapes.

In this study, we analysed the distribution, expansion and colonization patterns, and genetic differentiation among Psittacanthus rhynchanthus populations in Mesoamerica. Specifically, we determine the effects of major historical events and geographic barriers on population divergence using nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequence data and the impact of Pleistocene glacial cycles on the distribution dynamics of P. rhynchanthus using ecological niche modelling (ENM). Our results showed that P. rhynchanthus populations split into two lineages, one distributed on the Yucatan Peninsula and the second along the Pacific and Atlantic slopes and Honduras, approximately 1 million years ago. The two lineages were fragmented at the last interglacial according to ENM predictions and experienced postglacial range expansion during the Last Glacial Maximum. Analysis of climate differentiation and niche models showed that both lineages have different climatic preferences, where the climatic characteristics of the Yucatan populations are not fully represented in the rest of the distribution range of P. rhynchanthus. Additionally, our study suggests that Pleistocene expansion of suitable habitat, environmental segregation (ecological barrier between regions) and, perhaps host shifts, have acted as the isolation mechanisms between the two lineages.

Understanding the mechanisms underlying biological invasions and rapid adaptation to global change remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in small populations lacking in genetic variation. Two understudied mechanisms that could facilitate adaptive evolution and adaptive plasticity are the increased genetic variation due to transposable elements (TEs), and associated or independent modification of gene expression through epigenetic changes. 2. Here, we focus on the potential role of these genetic and non-genetic mechanisms for facilitating invasion success. Because novel or stressful environments are known to induce both epigenetic changes and TE activity, these mechanisms may play an underappreciated role in generating phenotypic and genetic variation for selection to act on. We review how these mechanisms operate, the evidence for how they respond to novel or stressful environments, and how these mechanisms can contribute to the success of biological invasions by facilitating adaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity. 3. Because genetic and phenotypic variations due to TEs and epigenetic changes are often well regulated or hidden in the native environment, the independent and combined contribution of these mechanisms may only become important when populations colonize novel environments. A focus on the mechanisms that generate and control the expression of this variation in new environments may provide insights into biological invasions that would otherwise not be obvious. 4. Global changes and human activities impact on ecosystems and allow new opportunities for biological invasions. Invasive species succeed by adapting rapidly to new environments. The degree to which rapid responses to environmental change could be mediated by the epigenome-the regulatory system that integrates how environmental and genomic variation jointly shape phenotypic variation-requires greater attention if we want to understand the mechanisms by which populations successfully colonize and adapt to new environments.",,,,"; Vieira, Cristina/Q-3137-2017","MARIN, Pierre/0000-0002-8304-138X; Vieira, Cristina/0000-0003-3414-3993; Maury, Stephane/0000-0003-0481-0847",,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,FEB,2020,34,2,,,,,385,400,,10.1111/1365-2435.13317,,,,,,,WOS:000515673000008,,,,,,

It is typically assumed that dispersal and demography traits evolve independently, but abundant evidence points to correlations between them that may be positive or negative and genetic, maternal, or environmental. We sought to understand how demography-dispersal correlations modify the eco-evolutionary dynamics of range expansion. We first explored this question with the beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, a laboratory model in which evolutionary acceleration of invasion has been demonstrated. We then built a simulation model to explore the role of trait correlations in this system and more generally. We found that positive correlations amplify the positive influence of evolution on speed and variability while negative correlations (such as we found empirically) constrain that influence. Strong negative genetic correlations can even cause evolution to decelerate invasion. Genetic and nongenetic (maternal and environmental) correlations had similar effects on some measures of invasion but different effects on others.

Recent theoretical, experimental, and empirical work has identified two particularly interesting phenomena in the context of species range expansions: (i) gene surfing and the relaxation of natural selection and (ii) spatial sorting. The former can lead to an accumulation of deleterious mutations at range edges, causing an expansion load and slowing down expansion. The latter can create gradients in dispersal-related traits along the expansion axis and cause an acceleration of expansion. We present a theoretical framework that treats spatial sorting and gene surfing as spatial versions of natural selection and genetic drift, respectively. This model allows us to analytically study how gene surfing and spatial sorting interact and derive the probability of fixation of pleiotropic mutations at the expansion front. We use our results to predict the coevolution of mean fitness and dispersal rates, taking into account the effects of random genetic drift, natural selection, and spatial sorting, as well as correlations between fitness- and dispersal-related traits. We identify a rescue effect of spatial sorting, where the evolution of higher dispersal rates at the leading edge rescues the population from incurring expansion load.",,,,"Peischl, Stephan/AAT-3078-2020","Peischl, Stephan/0000-0002-0474-6104",,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0147,1537-5323,,,,FEB,2020,195,2,,,,,349,360,,10.1086/705993,,,,,,,WOS:000512604000018,32017619,,,,,

Specifically, we analyzed cranial phenotypic variation of the nine-banded armadillo, comparing ecological associations throughout its native range with those experienced by invasive populations in the United States. We also compared the climatic conditions faced by native and invader armadillos to determine whether the species has broadened its environmental tolerance or remained within its native climatic pool. Our study shows that D. novemcinctus exhibits pronounced morphological variation through its range and that the phenotypic pattern in newly invaded areas departs from trends of the species in its native range. The morphological differences exhibited by invader armadillos can be related to their reduced reliance on myrmecophagy, with armadillos from temperate open areas in North America exploiting a broader range of dietary items. Moreover, we found the climatic conditions faced by alien armadillos during the initial phases of their Nearctic invasion fell within the native climatic range. In sum, high phenotypic variability and substantial environmental tolerance in the nine-banded armadillo help to explain its nearly ubiquitous distribution across contrasting ecosystems in its native range as well as its successful Nearctic invasion.

In this study, we assessed variation in behavioral and morphological traits, as well as their covariations, in replicated southern and northern European populations of the northward expanding dragonfly Crocothemis erythraea. Larvae from northern populations were, on average, darker in color, and therefore, better camouflaged than larvae from southern populations. However, there was no difference in activity level. Darkness and activity were positively correlated in larvae from northern populations, whereas this trait covariation was missing in southern populations. This suggests the emergence of alternative strategies in time-limited northern populations, a higher activity level that required better camouflage through darker coloration, while less active larvae benefited from an energy-saving strategy by reducing the investment in costly traits, such as body darkness. We further found that larger larvae emerged into larger adults, with a higher investment in flight morphology.

We found that the Great Lakes and the additive influence of forest stands with either low or high canopy cover and deep lake-effect snow have disrupted gene flow, whereas intermediate forest cover has facilitated gene flow. Functional connectivity in southern Ontario is relatively low and was limited in part by the low amount of forest cover. Pathways across the Great Lakes were through the Niagara region and through the Lower Peninsula of Michigan over the Straits of Mackinac and the St. Marys River.

Location The dry, western side of the Great Dividing Range in northern New South Wales, eastern Australia. Taxon The rusty fig (Ficus rubiginosa, Moraceae), its pollinator and the pollinator's parasitoids. Methods We measured fruit (syconia) set per tree, seed set per syconium and fig-wasp numbers (pollinators and non-pollinators) per syconium in a total of 62 trees in 24 populations covering three distributional zones - the dry, western margin of the species' range, a more mesic, eastern margin at the species' altitudinal limit, and the zone between these two margins. These results were modelled against F. rubiginosa population size, the position of plant populations in relation to range margins, and climatic gradients of temperature and rainfall. Results Lower rates of pollinator parasitism and less pollinator competition correlated with increased reproductive success in the pollinator and increased male fitness (in terms of pollen dispersal) and female fitness (in terms of seed per syconium) in isolated trees of F. rubiginosa, compared with trees in larger populations, particularly at F. rubiginosa's mesic, expanding range margin.

In general, two recurring themes are of central theoretical interest. First, immigration, diversification, and extinction typically depend on island geographical properties (e.g., area, isolation, and age). Second, predictable ecological and evolutionary trajectories readily occur after colonization, such as the evolution of adaptive trait syndromes, trends toward specialization, adaptive radiation, and eventual ecological decline. Hypotheses such as the taxon cycle draw on several of these themes to posit particular constraints on colonization and subsequent eco-evolutionary dynamics. However, it has been challenging to examine these integrated dynamics with traditional methods. Here, we combine phylogenomics, population genomics and phenomics, to unravel community assembly dynamics among Pheidole (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) ants in the isolated Fijian archipelago. We uphold basic island biogeographic predictions that isolated islands accumulate diversity primarily through in situ evolution rather than dispersal, and population genomic support for taxon cycle predictions that endemic species have decreased dispersal ability and demography relative to regionally widespread taxa. However, rather than trending toward island syndromes, ecomorphological diversification in Fiji was intense, filling much of the genus-level global morphospace. Furthermore, while most endemic species exhibit demographic decline and reduced dispersal, we show that the archipelago is not an evolutionary dead-end. Rather, several endemic species show signatures of population and range expansion, including a successful colonization to the Cook islands.

To overcome ecological limitation, local adaptation of peripheral populations is assumed necessary to extend niche space and thus to potentially facilitate species' range expansion. However, adaptive changes do not necessarily correspond to current ecological marginality. Instead, population history may provide a fuller context for understanding patterns of local adaptation within the species range. Here, we test whether local adaptation to current conditions or population history explains current species distribution in an annual heterocarpic species, Atriplex tatarica, in Europe. The ecological marginality and population history were estimated using species distribution modelling (SDM) and 13 microsatellite markers. To test for local adaptation, we evaluated the population performance of both currently central and currently peripheral populations by examining germination and growth traits under three temperature regimes which correspond to climates within, and also beyond, the species' current range. In addition, we compared Bayesian estimates of population differentiation in neutral genetic markers and quantitative traits to test whether phenotypic differentiation evolved by local adaptation and/or by genetic drift. We found population performances were not higher under temperature regimes corresponding to their own habitats, suggesting that patterns of local adaptation in A. tatarica do not correspond to current centre-periphery gradient. In contrast, population genetic structure indicated a strong influence of population history on variation in the germination phenotype. Species distribution modelling suggested a more cold-tolerant genetic lineage was located at the species' range periphery during the last glacial period. Meanwhile, a less cold-tolerant lineage occurred in more suitable areas of the Balkan Peninsula and southeastern Europe.

We studied this question in North American Arabidopsis lyrata, whose current distribution is shaped by post-glacial range expansion from two refugia, resulting in two distinct genetic clusters covering comparable climatic gradients. Using pooled whole-genome sequence data of 41 outcrossing populations, we identified loci associated with three niche-determining climatic variables in the two clusters and compared these outliers. Little evidence was found for parallelism in climate adaptation for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and for genes with an accumulation of outlier SNPs. Significantly increased selection coefficients supported them as candidates of climate adaptation. However, the fraction of gene ontology (GO) terms shared between clusters was higher compared to outlier SNPs and outlier genes, suggesting that selection acts on similar pathways but not necessarily the same genes. Enriched GO terms involved responses to abiotic and biotic stress, circadian rhythm and development, with flower development and reproduction being among the most frequently detected. In line with GO enrichment, regulators of flowering time were detected as outlier genes. Our results suggest that while adaptation to environmental gradients on the genomic level are lineage-specific in A. lyrata, similar biological processes seem to be involved.

I hypothesize that expansion of one species (the founder) after the last glacial maximum (LGM) into areas that were glaciated has hindered expansion of its competitor (the latecomer). If true, I predict that range and niche sizes of two congeners are more disproportionate within the previously glaciated areas (i.e. the areas of post-glacial expansion) than within areas that were not glaciated. I also predict that niche partitioning is reduced within previously glaciated areas. If true, range and climatic niche overlap of two congeners is smaller in the previously glaciated areas than in non-glaciated areas. Location North America. Taxon Non-volant mammals. Methods I calculate species range size for 87 congeneric species pairs and climatic niche hypervolume for 71 pairs, separately for areas that were and were not glaciated during the LGM. I then compare (a) range and climatic niche size ratio and (b) range and climatic niche overlap for each species pair between areas that were and were not glaciated using a paired t test. Results Congeneric species pairs exhibit more disproportionate range areas and climatic niche hypervolumes, and smaller range and climatic niche overlap within previously glaciated areas, in comparison with areas that were not glaciated during the LGM. Main conclusions Interspecific competition has likely hindered post-glacial range expansion of some species into deglaciated areas. Similarly to the founder effect documented on the intraspecific level, the founder species may hinder the expansion of the latecomer. Consequently, one species may expand over very large areas whereas its competitor may expand very little or not at all.

If so, what processes contribute to this pattern? (2) How is dietary breadth related to performance across multiple host species in monarch populations? (3) Does the coefficient of variation in performance vary across sympatric versus allopatric hosts?

These life-history traits are known to be under selection by changing local environmental conditions, but they may also evolve by spatial sorting. While local natural selection and spatial sorting are mainly studied in model organisms, we do not know the degree to which these processes are relevant in the wild, despite their importance to a comprehensive understanding of species' resistance and tolerance to climate change. Methods The wasp spider Argiope bruennichi has undergone a natural range expansion - from the Mediterranean to Northern Europe during the recent decades. Using reciprocal common garden experiments in the laboratory, we studied differences in crucial traits between replicated core (Southern France) and edge (Baltic States) populations. We tested theoretical predictions of enhanced dispersal (ballooning behaviour) and reproductive performance (fecundity and winter survival) at the expansion front due to spatial sorting and local environmental conditions. Results Dispersal rates were not consistently higher at the northern expansion front, but were impacted by the overwintering climatic conditions experienced, such that dispersal was higher when spiderlings had experienced winter conditions as occur in their region. Hatching success and winter survival were lower at the range border. In agreement with theoretical predictions, spiders from the northern leading edge invested more in reproduction for their given body size. Conclusions We found no evidence for spatial sorting leading to higher dispersal in northern range edge populations of A. bruennichi. However, reproductive investment and overwintering survival between core and edge populations differed.

Invasions can often be disproportionately driven by a single sex, with differences in behavioural mechanisms between the sexes potentially underlying sex-biased invasiveness. Here, we took an animal personality approach to study the behaviour of two repeatedly successful congeneric invasive species, the western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, and the eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki. In each species, we investigated whether males and females shared common personality traits (i.e. behavioural types and behavioural syndromes), with the aim of identifying possible behavioural mechanisms that could help explain why mosquitofish invasions are often characterised by sex-biased founder populations. We found sex-dependent personality, although sex differences varied between species. Male G. affinis were bolder and less social than female G. affinis, whereas we found no behavioural type differences between the sexes in G. holbrooki. We also found a consistent correlation between boldness and exploration in both sexes within G. affinis, but this correlation was weak in G. holbrooki. Finally, exploration was also correlated with sociability in male G. affinis, but not in females. Our results suggest that behavioural tendencies may diverge, both among species and between the sexes, because of adaptation experienced during different invasion pathways. Broadly, identifying the behavioural mechanisms that predict an individual's 'invasiveness' may be difficult to tease apart between species because each invasion is characterised by different abiotic and biotic interactions that likely require different suites of behaviours. Future studies are needed to elucidate whether, in fact, personality variation between the sexes can mediate the occurrence of sex-biased invasions.",,,,"Cote, Julien/B-7809-2011; Michelangeli, Marcus/AAN-2412-2020; Bertram, Michael/AAV-9211-2020; Sih, Andrew/P-7985-2015; Chapple, David/B-9073-2008","Michelangeli, Marcus/0000-0002-0053-6759; Bertram, Michael/0000-0001-5320-8444; Wong, Bob/0000-0001-9352-6500; Sih, Andrew/0000-0001-6161-1663; Chapple, David/0000-0002-7720-6280",,,,,,,,,,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,,,APR,2020,22,4,,,,,1353,1364,,10.1007/s10530-019-02187-3,,JAN 2020,,,,,WOS:000505465100001,,,,,,

Its occurrence in southeast Florida extends along nearly 70km of coastline, from near the Port of Miami, Miami-Dade County, northward to Deerfield Beach, Broward County. It occurs abundantly as an epizoite on octocorals, attaining population densities of 25 individuals and more per 10-cm long octocoral stem. The surface texture of octocoral hosts (rough, smooth) did not affect the densities of the ophiuroid epizoites, and there were significantly greater abundances on octocorals during two winter sampling periods than in the summer. Beige and orange-coloured morphs are sometimes present on the same octocoral stem. Gut content analysis supported a suspension feeding mode, revealing essentially identical ingested items in both colour morphs with a preponderance of amorphous detritus and filamentous algae. Molecular genetic evidence (COI & 16s) has established the identity of O. mirabilis and its relationship to invasive Brazilian populations. The orange and beige morphs form two distinct, but closely related lineages that may represent two separate introductions. The orange morph shares haplotypes with Brazilian and Caribbean specimens suggesting a further range expansion of the 'original' invasion. The beige morph, however, shares haplotypes with specimens from the Mexican Pacific and Peru and potentially represents a secondary introduction. Traits promoting dispersal and establishment of this species in new habitats are manifold: vagility and ability to cling tightly to diverse host taxa (e.g. sponges, cnidarians, bryozoans, and echinoderms), frequent asexual reproduction (fissiparity), suspension feeding, including a wide range of dietary items, possession of integument-covered ossicles and arm spines offering protection from predators, and an effective competitive edge over associated microbiota for substrate space.",,,,,"Dettloff, Kyle/0000-0001-8512-2733; Alitto, Renata/0000-0001-9732-4877",,,,,,,,,,,,0065-2881,2162-5875,978-0-12-821529-6,,,,2020,87,,,,,,443,472,,10.1016/bs.amb.2020.08.010,,,,,,,WOS:000610787200016,33293019,,,,,

Here, we examine feedback effects from the rhizosphere of living plants, decomposing litter and their combination. 2. We used four pairs of climate warming-induced range-expanding plant species and congeneric natives, and examined PSF effects on plant biomass production, as well as on decomposition in their new range. 3. We tested the hypothesis that the plant rhizosphere provides less negative feedback to range-expanders than to the congeneric natives, and that feedback mediated by litter decomposition does not provide such a difference because decomposers might be less specialized than pathogens. To determine PSF, we used soil from the congener species within each pair as an 'away' soil to indicate whether range-expanders may have lost their specialized soil biota upon arrival in the novel range. 4. Our results show that although range-expanding plant species and their congeneric natives developed neutral PSF in both rhizosphere- and litter-conditioned soils, two of the four range-expanders produced more biomass than natives in soils conditioned by litter, that is, soils with high nutrient content. Shoot litter from two out of four range-expanding species decomposed more than that of natives, but decomposition was unaffected by soil conditioning. 5. Synthesis. We compared PSF effects of range-expanders and congeneric natives mediated via both the rhizosphere and litter using the congeneric species as a control. Under those conditions, PSF effects were neutral and not affected by plant origin.

As climate change alters ocean conditions, the dispersal of these larvae will be affected, with pervasive ecological and evolutionary consequences. We review the impacts of oceanic changes on larval transport, physiology, and behavior. We then discuss the implications for population connectivity and recruitment and evaluate life history strategies that will affect susceptibility to the effects of climate change on their dispersal patterns, with implications for understanding selective regimes in a future ocean. We find that physical oceanographic changes will impact dispersal by transporting larvae in different directions or inhibiting their movements while changing environmental factors, such as temperature, pH, salinity, oxygen, ultraviolet radiation, and turbidity, will affect the survival of larvae and alter their behavior. Reduced dispersal distance may make local adaptation more likely in well-connected populations with high genetic variation while reduced dispersal success will lower recruitment with implications for fishery stocks. Increased dispersal may spur adaptation by increasing genetic diversity among previously disconnected populations as well as increasing the likelihood of range expansions. We hypothesize that species with planktotrophic (feeding), calcifying, or weakly swimming larvae with specialized adult habitats will be most affected by climate change. We also propose that the adaptive value of retentive larval behaviors may decrease where transport trajectories follow changing climate envelopes and increase where transport trajectories drive larvae toward increasingly unsuitable conditions. Our holistic framework, combined with knowledge of regional ocean conditions and larval traits, can be used to produce powerful predictions of expected impacts on larval dispersal as well as the consequences for connectivity, range expansion, or recruitment. Based on our findings, we recommend that future studies take a holistic view of dispersal incorporating biological and oceanographic impacts of climate change rather than solely focusing on oceanography or physiology.

Despite this potential, identifying adaptive candidate loci is not trivial, and linking genotype to phenotype is a major challenge in contemporary genetics. Many of the population genetic approaches commonly used to identify adaptive candidates will simultaneously detect false positives, particularly in nonmodel species, where experimental evidence is seldom provided for putative roles of the adaptive candidates identified by outlier approaches. In this study, we use outcomes from population genetics, phenotype association, and gene expression analyses as multiple lines of evidence to validate candidate genes. Using lodgepole and jack pine as our nonmodel study species, we analyzed 17 adaptive candidate loci together with 78 putatively neutral loci at 58 locations across Canada (N > 800) to determine whether relationships could be established between these candidate loci and phenotype related to mountain pine beetle susceptibility. We identified two candidate loci that were significant across all population genetic tests, and demonstrated significant changes in transcript abundance in trees subjected to wounding or inoculation with the mountain pine beetle fungal associate Grosmannia clavigera. Both candidates are involved in central physiological processes that are likely to be invoked in a trees response to stress. One of these two candidate loci showed a significant association with mountain pine beetle attack status in lodgepole pine. The spatial distribution of the attack-associated allele further coincides with other indicators of susceptibility in lodgepole pine. These analyses, in which population genetics was combined with laboratory and field experimental validation approaches, represent first steps toward linking genetic variation to the phenotype of mountain pine beetle susceptibility in lodgepole and jack pine, and provide a roadmap for more comprehensive analyses.",,,,"Cooke, Janice E/G-5906-2011; Coltman, David/A-4453-2012","Cooke, Janice E/0000-0002-4990-628X; Peery, Rhiannon/0000-0003-4711-4702; Cullingham, Catherine/0000-0002-6715-0674; Coltman, David/0000-0002-1268-2307",,,,,,,,,,,,1752-4571,,,,,JAN,2020,13,1,,,SI,,48,61,,10.1111/eva.12773,,,,,,,WOS:000509003100004,31892943,,,,,

Weevil resistance was genetically positively correlated with tree height, height-to-diameter at breast height (DBH) ratio, and acoustic velocity. The accuracy of the different GS models tested (GBLUP, threshold GBLUP, Bayesian ridge regression, BayesC pi) was high and did not differ among each other. Multi-trait models performed similarly as single-trait models when all trees were phenotyped. However, when weevil attack data were not available for all trees, weevil resistance was more accurately predicted by integrating genetically correlated growth traits into multi-trait GS models. A GS index that corresponded to the breeders' priorities achieved near maximum gains for weevil resistance, acoustic velocity, and height growth, but a small decrease for DBH. The results of this study indicate that it is possible to breed for high-quality, weevil-resistant Norway spruce reforestation stock with high accuracy achieved from single-trait or multi-trait GS.",,,,"Lenz, Patrick/AAE-6233-2020","Lenz, Patrick/0000-0002-0184-9247",,,,,,,,,,,,1752-4571,,,,,JAN,2020,13,1,,,SI,,76,94,,10.1111/eva.12823,,,,,,,WOS:000509003100006,31892945,,,,,

The extent of continental glaciation on the western side of the North Pacific, including areas of East Asia, was more limited as compared with regions of North America, Europe and high-latitude areas of the North Pacific. Therefore, the effects of climate oscillations might have influenced species in dissimilar ways depending on the species' distribution. We used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite DNA (msDNA) markers to clarify the evolutionary history of masu salmon Oncorhynchus masou subspecies-complex (family Salmonidae) distributed in historically non-glaciated regions in the western North Pacific. No marked regional or subspecies-specific mtDNA haplotype associations were recognised, except for O. masou subsp., a lacustrine form endemic to Lake Biwa, an ancient lake in central Honshu. The landlocked subspecies O. masou formosanus, with a disjunct distribution on Taiwan Island, exhibited no diagnostic population features differing from the other subspecies, in either mtDNA or msDNA markers. Mismatch distribution and Bayesian skyline plot analyses indicated relatively recent range expansion and rapid population growth for masu salmon during the last glacial period (c. 0.1-0.15 Ma). Contrary to the mtDNA genealogy, Bayesian clustering using msDNA showed two main genetic clusters, mainly northern populations of the subspecies O. m. masou and populations of the subspecies O. m. ishikawae in southern areas of the Japanese Archipelago. Notably, O. m. formosanus on Taiwan Island was included in the O. m. masou group, and O. masou subsp. was included in the O. m. ishikawae group. Our results suggest that the masu salmon subspecies-complex in historically non-glaciated regions of the Temperate Northern Pacific is characterised by weak population structuring and shallow genetic differentiation among the subspecies, except for O. masou subsp. owing to its long isolation in Lake Biwa. Incomplete lineage sorting and historical inter-subspecies hybridisation, possibly due to secondary contact, seem to be plausible explanations for discrepancies in the mitochondrial DNA genealogy and nuclear DNA genetic structure.",,,,"Morita, Kentaro/G-2578-2015","Morita, Kentaro/0000-0002-7803-2438; Kawamura, Kouichi/0000-0002-8687-0626",,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,,,APR,2020,65,4,,,,,698,715,,10.1111/fwb.13460,,DEC 2019,,,,,WOS:000504814400001,,,,,,

K.; Morelli, Toni Lyn",,,Interactive range-limit theory (iRLT): An extension for predicting range shifts,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"A central theme of range-limit theory (RLT) posits that abiotic factors form high-latitude/altitude limits, whereas biotic interactions create lower limits. This hypothesis, often credited to Charles Darwin, is a pattern widely assumed to occur in nature. However, abiotic factors can impose constraints on both limits and there is scant evidence to support the latter prediction. Deviations from these predictions may arise from correlations between abiotic factors and biotic interactions, as a lack of data to evaluate the hypothesis, or be an artifact of scale. Combining two tenets of ecology-niche theory and predator-prey theory-provides an opportunity to understand how biotic interactions influence range limits and how this varies by trophic level. We propose an expansion of RLT, interactive RLT (iRLT), to understand the causes of range limits and predict range shifts. Incorporating the main predictions of Darwin's hypothesis, iRLT hypothesizes that abiotic and biotic factors can interact to impact both limits of a species' range. We summarize current thinking on range limits and perform an integrative review to evaluate support for iRLT and trophic differences along range margins, surveying the mammal community along the boreal-temperate and forest-tundra ecotones of North America. Our review suggests that range-limit dynamics are more nuanced and interactive than classically predicted by RLT. Many (57 of 70) studies indicate that biotic factors can ameliorate harsh climatic conditions along high-latitude/altitude limits. Conversely, abiotic factors can also mediate biotic interactions along low-latitude/altitude limits (44 of 68 studies). Both scenarios facilitate range expansion, contraction or stability depending on the strength and the direction of the abiotic or biotic factors. As predicted, biotic interactions most often occurred along lower limits, yet there were trophic differences. Carnivores were only limited by competitive interactions (n = 25), whereas herbivores were more influenced by predation and parasitism (77%; 55 of 71 studies). We highlight how these differences may create divergent range patterns along lower limits. We conclude by (a) summarizing iRLT; (b) contrasting how our model system and others fit this hypothesis and (c) suggesting future directions for evaluating iRLT.",,,,,"Siren, Alexej/0000-0003-3067-6418; Morelli, Toni Lyn/0000-0001-5865-5294",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,APR,2020,89,4,,,,,940,954,,10.1111/1365-2656.13150,,DEC 2019,,,,,WOS:000504738700001,31758805,,,,,

Here our goal is to improve the modelling procedure for marine invaders by coupling Species Distribution Models (SDMs) with an analysis of their univariate niche dynamics. In particular, we tested for the first time whether choosing model predictors among the stable niche dimensions was effective in improving predictions of invasive species expansion. Location Mediterranean Sea. Taxon Dusky spinefoot, Siganus luridus. Methods We analysed the univariate niche dynamics for S. luridus across its native and invaded ranges, by applying a standardized framework that allowed the identification of cases of niche stability or shift. We compared inter-range transferability of SDMs fitted with different combinations of labile or stable predictors. Finally, we evaluated interactions in SDM settings (calibration area, model technique and predictors set) on models' predictive ability, using independent data from the most recent phase of invasion. Results We detected a pattern of niche stability for several variables, especially salinity and bathymetry, which positively influenced model inter-ranges transferability: when the models calibrated in the native range include only stable niche axes, predictive ability is improved. We also identified a shift towards lower surface temperatures in the introduced range, which were almost never experienced by the species before invasion. The model calibrated within the combined ranges was the most ecologically congruent. Also, models calibrated in the invaded range allowed a correct prediction of range expansion, with the predicted suitable areas only slightly underestimated. Main conclusions We provide the first evidence that using conserved predictors in SDMs improves inter-range projections of expanding invasive species. Variable selection, calibration area and modelling technique all matter when modelling invasive species, with important interaction effects.

Additionally, differences in the behaviour of hybrids may lead to deleterious ecosystem effects that compound any negative impacts of the invading parental species. Invasive silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) provide an opportunity to evaluate how hybridisation may influence the behaviour, dispersal, and spread of an invasive species introgressive complex. In order to investigate the role hybrids may have in the invasion ecology of bigheaded carps, we examined the distribution, movements, and environmental cues for movement of two invasive fishes and their hybrids in the Illinois River (U.S.A.). Early generation hybrids (e.g. F-1,F-2, and first-generation backcross individuals) composed a greater proportion of the population at the invasion front where abundances of bigheaded carp were low. A greater proportion of early hybrids passed through dams upstream towards the invasion front than did other hybrids and parental species. The movements and environmental cues for movement of late-generation backcrosses (more genetically similar to parental genotype) were not different from the parental species with which they shared the most alleles. Although the direction of the relationship between movement and environment was sometimes different for the parental species and associated advanced generation hybrids, these results indicate that management for parental species will also affect most hybrids. Although early generation hybrids are rare, our results indicate they may disperse towards low-density population zones (i.e. invasion fronts) or are produced at greater frequency in low-density areas. These rare hybrids have the potential to produce a variety of unique genetic combinations that could result in more rapid adaptation of a non-native population to their invaded range potentially facilitating the establishment of invasive species.",,,,"Garvey, James/AAO-5698-2021","Coulter, Alison/0000-0002-5604-6513",,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,,,APR,2020,65,4,,,,,716,730,,10.1111/fwb.13461,,DEC 2019,,,,,WOS:000503620100001,,,,,,

Although evidence has been provided for an increasing number of exotic species reaching high elevations, the mechanisms behind still remain to be resolved, specifically, as to what extent processes of plasticity and adaptation are involved in overcoming these environmental barriers. In order to test for the role of genetic differentiation, specifically attributable to changes in water availability and UV-B radiation along elevational gradients in exotic plant species, we conducted a greenhouse experiment with eleven exotic herbaceous plant species sampled along an elevational gradient from 1500 to 3000 m a.s.l. in Drakensberg, South Africa. Seeds were collected across sections over the entire elevational gradient of Sani Pass. The experiment was run in a greenhouse with individuals grown from seeds of different elevational origins and subjected to combinations of three levels of UV-B radiation and two levels of soil moisture. Measures of performance and functional traits were repeatedly assessed as response measures in a species-wise manner. The results revealed a significant impairment of plant performance by increased levels of UV-B radiation as well as by reduced water availability. This emphasizes the existence of cross-resistance mechanisms that alleviate the negative impacts if plants are subjected to both combined stressors at the same time. Additionally, there seems to be a strong dependency of leaf trait responses on the developmental stage of the individual. We found evidence for adaptive processes related to increasing UV-B radiation levels in high montane areas, suggesting that factors fostering evolutionary responses, such as longer residence time and high genetic diversity could promote additional ascent of exotic species into high elevation areas.",,,,,"Erfmeier, Alexandra/0000-0002-1002-9216; Watermann, Lena Yasmin/0000-0002-8905-0498",,,,,,,,,,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,,,MAR,2020,22,3,,,,,1203,1218,,10.1007/s10530-019-02173-9,,DEC 2019,,,,,WOS:000503363800002,,,,,,

Location North America, forest habitats along former Wisconsinan glaciation line. Taxon Lumbricus terrestris, L. rubellus. Methods Lumbricus terrestris and L. rubellus co-occur in the same habitats but differ in ecology and use as fishing bait. Both species were sampled in five transects ranging from the east to the west coast of northern North America, including major dispersal barriers, three different climate zones, and bait shops near sampling locations. Genetic diversity and structure were compared between the two species, and the presence of free-living bait shop genotypes was assessed using four markers (COI, 16S rDNA, 12S rDNA, and H3). Results Populations of both species were genetically diverse with some geographic structure, which was more pronounced in L. terrestris than in L. rubellus.

Furthermore, two distinct genetic clades of L. terrestris co-occurred only in the two most distant transects (Alberta and Minnesota). Genotypes identical to bait individuals were omnipresent in field populations of L. terrestris. Main Conclusions Genetic diversity was high in both species, and invasive populations represented a genetic subset of European earthworms.

Spiny frogs of the genus Nanorana are a characteristic faunal group of the Himalaya-Tibet orogen (HTO). We examine the phylogeny of these frogs to explore alternative biogeographic scenarios for their origin in the Greater Himalaya, namely, immigration, South Tibetan origin, strict vicariance. We sequenced 150 Nanorana samples from 62 localities for three mitochondrial (1,524 bp) and three nuclear markers (2,043 bp) and complemented the data with sequence data available from GenBank. We reconstructed a gene tree, phylogenetic networks, and ancestral areas. Based on the nuDNA, we also generated a time-calibrated species tree. The results revealed two major clades (Nanorana and Quasipaa), which originated in the Lower Miocene from eastern China and subsequently spread into the HTO (Nanorana). Five well-supported subclades are found within Nanorana: from the East, Central, and Northwest Himalaya, the Tibetan Plateau, and the southeastern Plateau margin. The latter subclade represents the most basal group (subgenus Chaparana), the Plateau group (Nanorana) represents the sister clade to all species of the Greater Himalaya (Paa). We found no evidence for an east-west range expansion of Paa along the Himalaya, nor clear support for a strict vicariance model. Diversification in each of the three Himalayan subclades has probably occurred in distinct areas. Specimens from the NW Himalaya are placed basally relative to the highly diverse Central Himalayan group, while the lineage from the Tibetan Plateau is placed within a more terminal clade.

We investigated Scots pine suitability to MPB as a host in the introduced range of the pine populations. We compared chemotypic similarity of foliage between introduced and native Scots pine populations, and then determined the suitability of introduced populations to MPB. Suitability was assessed based on whether beetles produce aggregation pheromone components and complete development in Scots pine bolts.

Current climate warming enables plant species and soil organisms to expand their range to higher latitudes and altitudes. At the same time, climate change increases the incidence of extreme weather events such as drought. While it is expected that plants and soil organisms originating from the south are better able to cope with drought, little is known about the consequences of their range shifts on soil functioning under drought events. 2. Here, we test how range-expanding plant species and soil communities may influence soil functioning under drought. We performed a full-factorial outdoor meso-cosm experiment with plant communities of range expanders or related natives, with soil inocula from the novel or the original range, with or without summer drought. We measured litter decomposition, carbon mineralization and enzyme activities, substrate-induced respiration and the relative abundance of soil saprophytic fungi immediately after drought and at 6 and 12 weeks after rewetting. 3. Drought decreased all soil functions regardless of plant and soil origin except one; soil respiration was less reduced in soils of range-expanding plant communities, suggesting stronger resistance to drought. After rewetting, soil functioning responses depended on plant and soil origin. Soils of native plant communities with a history of drought had more litter mass loss and higher relative abundance of saprophytic fungi than soils without drought and soils of range expanders. Functions of soil from range expanders recovered in a more conservative manner than soils of natives, as litter mass loss did not exceed the control rates. At the end of the experiment, after rewetting, most soil functions in mesocosms with drought history did not differ anymore from the control. 4.

Choosing particular plant genotypes for domestication and subsequent cultivar selection can narrow the gene pools of crop plants to a degree that they are no longer able to benefit from microbial mutualists. Elevated mineral nutrient levels in cultivated soils also reduce the dependence of crops on nutritional support by mutualists such as mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia. Thus, current ways of crop production are predestined to compromise the propagation and function of microbial symbionts, limiting their long-term benefits for plant yield stability. The influence of mutualists on non-native plant establishment and spread, i.e. biological invasions, provides an unexplored analogue to contemporary crop production that accounts for mutualistic services from symbionts like rhizobia and mycorrhizae. The historical exposure of organisms to biotic interactions over evolutionary timescales, or so-called eco-evolutionary experience (EEE), has been used to explain the success of such invasions. In this paper, we stress that consideration of the EEE concept can shed light on how to overcome the loss of microbial mutualist functions following crop domestication and breeding.

Using various diversity estimates and community ecology approaches, we detect a latitudinal gradient of species richness that significantly decreased Northward. We show that shrews (Crocidura) represent a very important component of micro-mammal fauna in West African towns and villages, especially at lower latitudes. We also demonstrate that invasive and native synanthropic rodents do not distribute randomly in West Africa, which suggests that invasive species dynamics and history differ markedly, and that they involve gradual, as well as human-mediated, long distance dispersal.

In Atlantic coastal rivers of the United States, large catfishes introduced from the Gulf of Mexico drainages have become established and contributed to native species declines. Flathead Catfish Pylodictis olivaris were introduced to the Chesapeake Bay drainage in the 1960s and 1970s in the James and Potomac river systems in the eastern United States. Diet studies have found James River Flathead Catfish function as apex predators and are known to consume at-risk Alosa spp. To limit further range expansion and impacts to native species, resource management agencies need information on population characteristics to support population assessments and management plan development. Thus, we examined temporal trends in growth rates and estimated total instantaneous mortality for tidal James River Flathead Catfish collected by Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries from 1997 to 2015. Parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth model with length-at-age observations pooled across sampling years were estimated as L-infinity = 1,059 mm, k= 0.231/y, and t(0) = 0.55 y. Flathead Catfish growth differed among sampling years, especially for the years 2007 and 2014, which had the largest sample sizes. However, there were no obvious temporal trends in growth trajectories. James River Flathead Catfish tend to grow much faster than most populations used in development of the relative growth index, but the species is known to grow faster in its nonnative range. Consequently, scientists and managers should use caution when applying growth indices if native and nonnative populations are not expressly considered in development of the index. We estimated total instantaneous mortality as Z 0.50 and mean natural mortality from six estimators as M 0.30. A lack of older individuals in the population means that mortality rates may be overestimated as a result of gear selectivity or ongoing maturation of the population. These data provide information to support future work examining the species in the James River and development of population models to evaluate management strategies and management plans.",,,,"Bunch, Aaron J./AAD-5528-2020; Schmitt, Joseph/AAC-3110-2021","Bunch, Aaron J./0000-0002-1855-5616; Schmitt, Joseph/0000-0002-8354-4067; Hilling, Corbin/0000-0003-4040-9516",,,,,,,,,,,,1944-687X,,,,,DEC,2019,10,2,,,,,641,652,,10.3996/052019-JFWM-033,,,,,,,WOS:000503423500033,,,,,,

The northeastern woodland ant Aphaenogaster picea occurs up to approximately 45 degrees N in central Maine. We combined presence/absence surveys with classification tree analysis to characterize its northern range limit and assayed two measures of cold resistance operating on different timescales to determine whether and how marginal populations adapt to environmental extremes. The range boundary of A. picea was predicted primarily by temperature, but low winter temperatures did not emerge as the primary correlate of species occurrence. Low summer temperatures and high seasonal variability predicted absence above the boundary, whereas high mean annual temperature (MAT) predicted presence in southern Maine. In contrast, assays of cold resistance across multiple sites were consistent with the hypothesis of local cold adaptation at the range edge: among populations, there was a 4-min reduction in chill coma recovery time across a 2 degrees reduction in MAT. Baseline resistance and capacity for additional plastic cold hardening shifted in opposite directions, with hardening capacity approaching zero at the coldest sites. This trade-off between baseline resistance and cold-hardening capacity suggests that populations at range edges may adapt to colder temperatures through genetic assimilation of plastic responses, potentially constraining further adaptation and range expansion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0147,1537-5323,,,,DEC,2019,194,6,,,,,E151,E163,,10.1086/705939,,,,,,,WOS:000501897400002,31738107,,,,,

Traditionally, biogeographic inference has relied on distinct lines of evidence, including DNA sequences, fossils and hindcasted ecological niche models. In this review we propose that the development of integrative modeling approaches that leverage multiple distinct data types from diverse disciplines has the potential to revolutionize the field of biogeography. Although each data type contains information on a distinct aspect of species' biogeographic histories, few studies formally integrate multiple types in analysis. For example, post hoc congruence among analyses based on different data types (e.g. fossils and genetics) is commonly assumed to indicate likely biogeographic histories. Unfortunately, analyses of different data often reach discordant conclusions. Thus, fundamental and unresolved debates continue regarding speed and timing of postglacial migration, location and size of glacial refugia, and degree of long distance dispersal. Formal statistical integration can help address these issues. More specifically, formal integration can leverage all available evidence, account for inherent biases associated with different data types, and quantify data and process uncertainty. Novel, quantitative integration of data and models across fields is now possible due to recent advances in cyberinfrastructure, spatial modeling, online and aggregated ecological databases, data processing and quantitative methods. Our purpose is to make the case for and give examples of rigorous integration of genetic, fossil and environmental/occurrence data for inferring biogeographic history. In particular, we 1) review the need for such a framework; 2) explain common data types and approaches used to infer biogeographic history (and the challenges with each); 3) review state-of-the-art examples of data integration in biogeography; 4) lay out a series of novel, suggested improvements on current methods; and 5) provide an outlook on technical feasibility and future opportunities.",,,,"Smith, Adam B./H-6906-2019","Robinson, John/0000-0002-9782-1598",,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,,,DEC,2019,42,12,,,SI,,1991,2011,,10.1111/ecog.04327,,,,,,,WOS:000501362200002,,,,,,

A key factor affecting range-shifts is the interaction with predators. Small mammals, being primary seed predators and dispersers in forest ecosystems, may play a major role in determining which plant species will successfully expand and the rate at which range-shifts will occur. Plants dispersing seeds beyond the species' current range limits will encounter seed predators to which these seeds are novel; however, empirical studies of seed predator-novel seed interactions are lacking. The aims of our study were to: 1) quantify seed selection by small mammals presented with 'novel' seeds; 2) quantify the post-selection fate of 'novel' seeds; and 3) identify seed traits that affect seed selection and post-selection seed fate. We designed a field experiment exposing small mammal communities to novel seeds produced by plants expected to shift their ranges in response to climate change. We matched novel seeds with reference 'familiar' seeds and studied key steps defining interactions between small mammals and novel seeds. We found that the probability of selection of a novel seed varied among species and was, at times, higher than the selection probability of familiar seeds. Key traits that affected seed selection and the distance a seed was dispersed for caching were shell hardness and seed mass. We also found that 33% of dispersed seeds were cached in optimal germination sites (e.g. within fallen logs and buried under the leaf litter mat). Through seed emergence trials we found that emergence was higher for larger seeds, suggesting that the role of small mammals may be modulated by emergence rates.

In the Laurentian Great Lakes, 21 native fish species have been extirpated from one or more lakes as a result of habitat alteration and destruction, overexploitation and invasive species since the 1800s. Over the same time period, 30 non-native species became established in at least one lake as a result of authorized and unauthorized introductions. This study examines temporal changes in taxonomic dissimilarity over 15 time periods spanning the last 150 years. Location Laurentian Great Lakes, North America. Methods Changes to the Great Lakes fish fauna were summarized in species lists by decade from 1870 to 2010. Taxonomic dissimilarity between and within communities was calculated using Jaccard's dissimilarity coefficient; the relative contribution of turnover (species replacement) and nestedness (species loss) to total taxonomic dissimilarity was also calculated. To test whether the Great Lakes have homogenized, we conducted a regression on multiple-site dissimilarity values over time. Results Native species richness in the Great Lakes exhibits a latitudinal gradient that reflects post-glacial history and current climate. We demonstrate that the establishment of non-native species and extirpation of native species has changed fish communities in each of the Great Lakes, with communities in Lake Superior differentiating the most (~23%) and in Lake Ontario the least (~12%) since 1870. Multiple-site dissimilarity ranges between ~50% and 53% per decade, and communities have become ~5.9% more similar over time since 1870. Main Conclusions Species introductions and extirpations have changed community composition, resulting in the fish communities becoming significantly more similar to one another over time and, thus, homogenized. As a result, ongoing management should prevent range expansion of native and non-native species to preserve the current distinctiveness of the Great Lakes fish communities.",,,,,"Campbell, Sara/0000-0001-7195-8898; Mandrak, Nicholas/0000-0001-8335-9681",,,,,,,,,,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,,,DEC,2019,25,12,,,,,1870,1878,,10.1111/ddi.12986,,,,,,,WOS:000495055200005,,,,,,

We monitored male activity of both populations in the Leiria region, i.e. over the whole SP distribution range using a systematic sampling along two transects, and studied Portuguese WPs at a larger geographical scale to explore their genetic diversity and spatial pattern of differentiation. Results showed that the WPs were genetically more diverse than the SP, with a strong pattern of isolation by distance both at large and small spatial scales, while the SP was very homogeneous over its whole range, without signature of its recent spatial expansion. Contrary to our expectations, no F1 hybrids were identified, even though we found an extended flight period of the SP, overlapping with the beginning of the WP reproductive period. Interestingly, the SP was found to be mostly limited to the sea shore where the WP is now scarce or absent, which could suggest competitive exclusion.

We first compared trait means and fitness functions among ranges, then we analyzed how trait means and selection strength of populations respond to varying aridity. Most traits varied such that landrace > invasive > native. Excluding reproduction, which was positively selected, most trait PCs experienced nonlinear selection in the native range but frequently shifted to directional selection in invasive and/or landrace ranges. The absence of strong clines for trait means in landrace and invasive populations suggest that agricultural practices and novel environments in source locations affected adaptive potential. Selection strength on faster reproductive phenology (negative directional) and leaf margin trait (disruptive) PCs coincided with increasing moisture. In native populations, higher aridity was associated with more days to reproduction, but landrace and invasive populations show stable mean time to reproduction with increasing moisture.

However, its effects on dispersal should depend on dispersal syndromes, i.e. how dispersal covaries with phenotypic traits, because these syndromes can drastically alter dispersal and subsequent ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Our comprehension of whether environmental factors such as habitat fragmentation generate and/or modify dispersal syndromes (i.e. conditional dispersal syndromes) is therefore key for biodiversity forecasting. Here we tested whether habitat fragmentation modulates dispersal syndromes by experimentally manipulating matrix harshness, a critical feature of habitat fragmentation, in ciliate microcosms. We found evidence for dispersal syndromes involving multiple traits linked to morphology (elongation and size), movement (velocity and linearity) and demography (growth rate and maximal population density). More importantly, these syndromes were modified by matrix harshness, with increased differences between residents and dispersers in morphology and movement traits, and decreased differences in growth rate as the matrix became increasingly harsh.

In the northwest Atlantic, an ecologically significant invasive bryozoan (Membranipora membranacea) has expanded its range northwards over the last 30 years. Warm ocean temperature has been linked to population outbreaks of M. membranacea within its established invasive range in southwestern Nova Scotia; however, rates of spread and the physical and biological factors affecting establishment of founding populations have not been explicitly quantified. Here, we use unique baseline data on presence/absence and abundance of this bryozoan near its current northern range limit to quantify rates of spread and identify factors influencing its establishment in three regions in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

Contrary to our predictions based on long-established populations in Nova Scotia, the abundance of M. membranacea was not strongly related to regional differences in ocean temperature at its northern range limit. Our results suggest that colder temperatures are not limiting the northward spread of this bryozoan in the northwest Atlantic.

We also conducted a survey to evaluate how shifting vegetation is modifying structural complexity, invertebrate communities, and ecosystem functioning at the ecotone. Excluding larger (> 2 cm diameter) predators did not affect vegetation or invertebrate structure or stability in either saltmarsh or mangrove habitats. The survey revealed that the two habitat types consistently differ in structural metrics, including vegetation height, inter-stem distance, and density, yet they support similar invertebrate and algal communities, soil properties, and predation rates. We conclude that although mangrove range expansion immediately modifies habitat structural properties, it is not altering larger predator consumptive effects, community stability, community composition, or some other ecosystem functions and properties at the ecotone.",,,,"Safak, Ilgar/AAC-4362-2021","Safak, Ilgar/0000-0001-7675-0770",,,,,,,,,,,,,1424-2818,,,,NOV,2019,11,11,,,,,,,208,10.3390/d11110208,,,,,,,WOS:000500005400003,,,,,,

Colonization of oceanic islands occurs through long-distance dispersals (LDDs) or metapopulation vicariance, the latter resulting in lineages being older than the islands they inhabit. If metapopulation vicariance is valid, island ages cannot be reliably used to provide maximum age constraints for molecular dating. We explore the relationships between the ages of members of a widespread plant genus (Planchonella, Sapotaceae) and their host islands across the Pacific to test various assumptions of dispersal and metapopulation vicariance. We sampled three nuclear DNA markers from 156 accessions representing some 100 Sapotaceae taxa, and analyzed these in BEAST with a relaxed clock to estimate divergence times and with a phylogeographic diffusion model to estimate range expansions over time. The phylogeny was calibrated with a secondary point (the root) and fossils from New Zealand. The dated phylogeny reveals that the ages of Planchonella species are, in most cases, consistent with the ages of the islands they inhabit. Planchonella is inferred to have originated in the Sahul Shelf region, to which it back-dispersed multiple times. Fiji has been an important source for range expansion in the Pacific for the past 23 myr. Our analyses reject metapopulation vicariance in all cases tested, including between oceanic islands, evolution of an endemic Fiji-Vanuatu flora, and westward rollback vicariance between Vanuatu and the Loyalty Islands. Repeated dispersal is the only mechanism able to explain the empirical data. The longest (8900 km) identified dispersal is between Palau in the Pacific and the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean, estimated at 2.2 Ma (0.4-4.8 Ma). The first split in a Hawaiian lineage (P. sandwicensis) matches the age of Necker Island (11.0 Ma), when its ancestor diverged into two species that are distinguished by purple and yellow fruits. Subsequent establishment across the Hawaiian archipelago supports, in part, progression rule colonization. In summary, we found no explanatory power in metapopulation vicariance and conclude that Planchonella has expanded its range across the Pacific by LDD. We contend that this will be seen in many other groups when analyzed in detail.",,,,,"Swenson, Ulf/0000-0003-1064-9404; Nylinder, Stephan/0000-0001-5199-7128",,,,,,,,,,,,1063-5157,1076-836X,,,,NOV,2019,68,6,,,,,1020,1033,,10.1093/sysbio/syz025,,,,,,,WOS:000498169600010,31157892,,,,,

We utilized the California Roadkill Observation System (CROS) to assess the quality of and potential contribution that volunteer-collected animal-vehicle collision (AVC) data to understand species ranges. We classified volunteers as professional biologists or non-professional users, and compared their rates of species observation and identification accuracy. Seventeen percent of the volunteers were professionals, but they provided 35% of the observations, and they observed a more diverse set of species than non-professionals. The accuracy of species identification was similar for both groups. We compared species' ranges estimated from CROS data with ranges derived from the largest available database of animal observations (Global Biodiversity Information Facility; GBIF). CROS observations expanded GBIF data-derived ranges for 139 of 411 species. Average range expansion was 8.2% for all species, including species with no range expansion, or 24.3% for species with range expansion. We also used species distribution models to estimate range sizes. Adding CROS observations to GBIF records expanded the average predicted species-range by 5%. Professional observers expanded previously-estimated ranges by an average of 1.1%, while non-professional observers expanded ranges by an average of 5.3%, reflecting their larger spatial coverage. While non-professional users observe fewer species, their larger number of observations and occurrence over a larger area improves our knowledge of the ranges of a number of species.

This process, called reproductive character displacement (RCD), leaves a characteristic pattern of geographic variation where divergence of traits between species is greater in sympatry than allopatry. However, because other forces can also cause similar patterns, care must be given in separating pattern from process. Here we show how the phylo-comparative method together with genomic data can be used to evaluate evolutionary processes at the population level in closely related species. Using this framework, we WA the role of RCD in speciation of two cricket species endemic to Anatolian mountains by quantifying patterns of character displacement, rates of evolution and adaptive divergence. Our results show differing patterns of character displacement between species for reproductive vs. non-reproductive characters and strong patterns of asymmetric divergence. We demonstrate diversification results from rapid divergence of reproductive traits towards multiple optima under the dual influence of strong drift and selection. These results present the first solid evidence for RCD in Anatolian mountains, quantify the amount of drift and selection necessary for RCD to lead to speciation, and demonstrate the utility of phylo-comparative methods for quantifying evolutionary parameters at the population level.",,,,"saglam, ismail/M-9431-2017","saglam, ismail/0000-0003-3136-7334",,,,,,,,,,,,1055-7903,1095-9513,,,,NOV,2019,140,,,,,,,,106597,10.1016/j.ympev.2019.106597,,,,,,,WOS:000489688500015,31445201,,,,,

We used 18,550 records from 260 datasets and species distribution modeling (SDM) to provide support for the climatically based and topographic hypotheses, which claim that current climate and topography affect species distribution patterns of plants. We also investigated (1) the geographical distribution of habitat suitability across biotic communities of the Southwest United States and northern Mexico, (2) the association between habitat suitability, climate variables and topography, and (3) the potential effects of climate change on the future distribution of buffelgrass. We found that the geographic pattern of suitability in the southwest generally increases west- and southward, with some high suitability areas also occurring in southern areas of Arizona, USA, and across the state of Sonora, Mexico. We observed that mean temperature and annual precipitation explain spatial variation in suitability better than other climatic and non-climatic variables. Climate change models indicated significant opportunities for contraction across the buffelgrass' range and fewer for range expansion. In all scenarios, SDMs predicted a high contraction of suitable habitat. Most of these contractions would occur in portions of the Sonoran Desert and the foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental.

Identifying the ecological, environmental and historical determinants of parasite distributions and diversity is therefore necessary to understand disease outbreaks under changing environments. Here, we identified the predictors and contributions of infection probability and phylogenetic diversity of Leucocytozoon (an avian blood parasite) at site and species levels across the New World. To explore spatial patterns in infection probability and lineage diversity for Leucocytozoon parasites, we surveyed 69 bird communities from Alaska to Patagonia. Using phylogenetic Bayesian hierarchical models and high-resolution satellite remote-sensing data, we determined the relative influence of climate, landscape, geography and host phylogeny on regional parasite community assembly. Infection rates and parasite diversity exhibited considerable variation across regions in the Americas. In opposition to the latitudinal gradient hypothesis, both the diversity and prevalence of Leucocytozoon parasites decreased towards the equator. Host relatedness and traits known to promote vector exposure neither predicted infection probability nor parasite diversity. Instead, the probability of a bird being infected with Leucocytozoon increased with increasing vegetation cover (NDVI) and moisture levels (NDWI), whereas the diversity of parasite lineages decreased with increasing NDVI. Infection rates and parasite diversity also tended to be higher in cooler regions and higher latitudes. Whereas temperature partially constrains Leucocytozoon diversity and infection rates, landscape features, such as vegetation cover and water body availability, play a significant role in modulating the probability of a bird being infected. This suggests that, for Leucocytozoon, the barriers to host shifting and parasite host range expansion are jointly determined by environmental filtering and landscape, but not by host phylogeny. Our results show that integrating host traits, host ancestry, bioclimatic data and microhabitat characteristics that are important for vector reproduction are imperative to understand and predict infection prevalence and diversity of vector-transmitted parasites. Unlike other vector-transmitted diseases, our results show that Leucocytozoon diversity and prevalence will likely decrease with warming temperatures.",,,,"Kirchgatter, Karin/D-8376-2013; Berv, Jacob/H-5421-2019; Fecchio, Alan/AAV-1040-2020; Bell, Jeffrey/Q-5057-2019; Fontana, Carla Suertegaray/AAG-7175-2020; Fontana, Carla/N-6402-2019; Anciaes, Marina/T-2576-2018; Pinho, Joao/D-8268-2013","Kirchgatter, Karin/0000-0002-2449-2316; Berv, Jacob/0000-0002-5962-0621; Fecchio, Alan/0000-0002-7319-0234; Bell, Jeffrey/0000-0001-9146-4318; Anciaes, Marina/0000-0003-2796-3395; Pinho, Joao/0000-0002-1830-0509; Weckstein, Jason/0000-0001-7941-5724; Gorosito, Cristian/0000-0002-9277-7903; Clark, Nicholas/0000-0001-7131-3301; Fontana, Carla/0000-0001-9423-0752; Lutz, Holly/0000-0001-6454-809X; Tkach, Vasyl/0000-0001-5084-7566",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,FEB,2020,89,2,,,,,423,435,,10.1111/1365-2656.13117,,OCT 2019,,,,,WOS:000493350700001,31571223,,,,,

Here, we ask on a global scale whether hybridization is linked to any of 11 traits related to plant life history, reproduction, genetic predisposition, and environment or opportunity. Given that hybridization is not evenly distributed across the plant tree of life, we use phylogenetic generalized least squares regression models and phylogenetic path analysis to detect statistical associations between hybridization and plant traits at both the family and genus levels. We find that perenniality and woodiness are each weakly associated with an increased frequency of hybridization in univariate analyses, but path analysis suggests that the direct linkage is between perenniality and increased hybridization (with woodiness having only an indirect relationship with hybridization via perenniality). Weak associations between higher rates of hybridization and higher outcrossing rates, abiotic pollination syndromes, vegetative reproductive modes, larger genomes, and less variable genome sizes are detectable in some cases but not others.

In the southeastern United States, freezing temperatures control the northern range limits of many invasive nonnative species. Here, we examine the influence of freezing temperatures and winter climate change on the northern range limits of an invasive nonnative tree-Schinus terebinthifolius (Brazilian pepper). Since introduction in the 1800s, Brazilian pepper has invaded ecosystems throughout south and central Florida to become the state's most widespread nonnative plant species. Although Brazilian pepper is sensitive to freezing temperatures, temperature controls on its northern distribution have not been adequately quantified. We used temperature and plant occurrence data to quantify the sensitivity of Brazilian pepper to freezing temperatures. Then, we examined the potential for range expansion under three alternative future climate scenarios (+2 degrees C, +4 degrees C, and +6 degrees C). Our analyses identify a strong nonlinear sigmoidal relationship between minimum temperature and Brazilian pepper presence, with a discrete threshold temperature occurring near -11 degrees C. Our future scenario analyses indicate that, in response to warming winter temperatures, Brazilian pepper is expected to expand northward and transform ecosystems in north Florida and across much of the Gulf of Mexico and south Atlantic coasts of the United States. These results underscore the importance of early detection and rapid response efforts to identify and manage the northward invasion of Brazilian pepper in response to climate change.

However, we found evidence for postintroduction genetic evolution by reanalyzing a published ddRADseq genomic dataset from 90 European invasive populations using genotype-environment association (GEA) methods and generalized dissimilarity modeling (GDM). Three loci, among which a putative heat-shock protein, exhibited significant allelic turnover along the gradient of winter precipitation that could be associated with ongoing range expansion.

Multivariate analysis and generalized linear models were used to determine environmental constraints on habitat suitability and requirements for D. geminata. During 2012-2017, D. geminata cells were detected at 33 out of 91 sites sampled. D. geminata was present in lower streams order, with low values of total and dissolved nutrients, conductivity, alkalinity, ions and solutes, and high values of dissolved oxygen and habitat quality, for the ranges of environmental variables measured at sampling sites. D. geminata abundance was negatively related to stream order. Our results prove that D. geminata is expanding its ecological spectrum, showing a wider tolerance to environmental conditions particularly for phosphorus and nitrogen, some ions such as magnesium, and even temperature, and they confirm some authors' hypothesis about the ecological behaviour of this invasive species. Range expansion and environmental preferences of D. geminata could modify the state of susceptibility to invasion in numerous waterbodies.",,,,,"Baffico, Gustavo/0000-0002-6178-3542",,,,,,,,,,,,1936-0584,1936-0592,,,,DEC,2019,12,8,,,,,,,e2148,10.1002/eco.2148,,OCT 2019,,,,,WOS:000491743400001,,,,,,

Poleward shifts may represent a homogeneous shift in distribution, seasonal northward movement of specific populations, or colonization processes at the poleward edge of the distribution. The ecosystem of the Bering Sea has been changing along with the climate, moving from an arctic to a subarctic system. Several fish species have been observed farther north than previously reported and in increasing abundances. We examined one of these fish species, Pacific cod, in the northern Bering Sea (NBS) to assess whether they migrated from another stock in the eastern Bering Sea (EBS), Gulf of Alaska, or Aleutian Islands, or whether they represent a separate population. Genetic analyses using 3,599 single nucleotide polymorphism markers indicated that nonspawning cod collected in August 2017 in the NBS were similar to spawning stocks of cod in the EBS. This result suggests escalating northward movement of the large EBS stock during summer months. Whether the cod observed in the NBS migrate south during winter to spawn or remain in the NBS as a sink population is unknown.",,,,,"Stevenson, Duane/0000-0003-0967-8400; Hollowed, Anne/0000-0002-4225-6026",,,,,,,,,,,,1752-4571,,,,,FEB,2020,13,2,,,,,362,375,,10.1111/eva.12874,,OCT 2019,,,,,WOS:000490956100001,31993082,,,,,

Long-term monitoring of breeding pairs has been conducted since 1976 up to present. Peregrine falcons were first established at breeding sites in coastal habitats, where they remained at stable low numbers until the early 1990's. Starting around 2000, numbers began to increase steadily, and current numbers have now reached historical population levels from the pre-DDT era. We documented a range expansion with increasing numbers of peregrines nesting in the fjords and inland valleys. We found that once a territory was colonized, the probability that a territory remained occupied was high (S > 0.958). During early stages of population recovery, the transitional probabilities of becoming or remaining a breeding territory were high (psi(N-B) > 0.40, psi(B-B) > 0.65) but declined over time, especially in coastal habitats. Moreover, the productivity per nest has also decreased over time at sites in coastal habitats in the former stronghold of the population. The levels of environmental pollutants in eggs of the peregrines have dropped sharply over the last few decades, and contaminant levels now seem to be below critical levels. Eggshells were relatively thin throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, but have increased to almost normal levels during the last 2 decades. Reductions in levels of organochlorine pollutants, especially DDT, appear to have been the main factor in explaining the population recovery. The territory dynamics are consistent with density-dependence and the low breeding success of the coastal-breeding peregrines is believed to be caused by declining numbers of colonial seabirds and other prey species.",,,,"Sandercock, Brett/L-1644-2016","Sandercock, Brett/0000-0002-9240-0268",,,,,,,,,,,,0963-9292,1573-3017,,,,DEC,2019,28,10,,,,,1160,1168,,10.1007/s10646-019-02111-4,,OCT 2019,,,,,WOS:000490837600001,31624990,,,,,

For example, shifts to traits associated with faster growth may be advantageous in range edge populations of invasive species to decrease generation time and thus promote rapid range expansion. We tested whether populations at the expanding range edges of two coastal plant species invasive in eastern Australia (Gladiolus gueinzii Kunze and Hydrocotyle bonariensis Lam.) possessed different carbon capture strategies compared with range core populations where they were first introduced. Pairwise leaf trait relationships between specific leaf area (SLA), photosynthetic rate (A(mass)), foliar nitrogen (N-mass) and foliar phosphorus (P-mass) were investigated for range edge and range core populations using standardised major axis (SMA) regression. Across species, SMA regression slopes for range core and range edge populations for all pairwise comparisons did not differ significantly from each other, suggesting that each species has a similar carbon capture strategy across its range. However, at a species level, H. bonariensis displayed significant shifts in trait values along a common regression slope for many pairwise comparisons. Range edge populations were found to have higher values for N-mass, A(mass) and SLA compared to range core populations and displayed greater nutrient use efficiency, suggesting that range edge populations are positioned further along the leaf economics spectrum towards faster growth strategies. In contrast, for G. gueinzii, leaf traits were positioned along a common regression slope with no difference in the trait values of range core and range edge populations. Our results suggest that there is selection for faster carbon capture strategies at range edges for some introduced species undergoing range expansion and this may be a contributing factor in explaining rapid range advance.",,,,"Leishman, Michelle/AAU-4102-2020; Tabassum, Samiya/H-8486-2014","Leishman, Michelle/0000-0003-4830-5797; Tabassum, Samiya/0000-0002-8402-8099",,,,,,,,,,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,,,FEB,2020,22,2,,,,,563,575,,10.1007/s10530-019-02111-9,,OCT 2019,,,,,WOS:000492455400001,,,,,,

Early arguments highlighted the role of ecological opportunity, with the idea that insects escape and radiate on new hosts, with subsequent hypotheses focusing on the interplay between host shifting and host tracking, coupled with isolation and fusion, in generating diversity. Because it is rarely possible to capture the initial stages of diversification, it is particularly difficult to ascertain the relative roles of geographic isolation versus host shifts in initiating the process. The current study examines genetic diversity between populations and hosts within a single species of endemic Hawaiian planthopper, Nesosydne umbratica (Hemiptera, Delphacidae). Given that the species was known as a host generalist occupying unrelated hosts, Clermontia (Campanulaceae) and Pipturus (Urticaceae), we set out to determine the relative importance of geography and host in structuring populations in the early stages of differentiation on the youngest islands of the Hawaiian chain. Results from extensive exon capture data showed that N. umbratica is highly structured, both by geography, with discrete populations on each volcano, and by host plant, with parallel radiations on Clermontia and Pipturus leading to extensive co-occurrence. The marked genetic structure suggests that populations can readily become established on novel hosts provided opportunity; subsequent adaptation allows monopolization of the new host. The results support the role of geographic isolation in structuring populations and with host shifts occurring as discrete events that facilitate subsequent parallel geographic range expansion.",,,,"Gillespie, Rosemary/AAF-4244-2019","Gillespie, Rosemary/0000-0003-0086-7424; Prost, Stefan/0000-0002-6229-3596; Brewer, Michael/0000-0002-1535-6929",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-1083,1365-294X,,,,OCT,2019,28,19,,,,,4513,4528,,10.1111/mec.15231,,OCT 2019,,,,,WOS:000489792300001,31484218,,,,,

Though phytophagous insects are an important component of Earth's biodiversity, there are few studies investigating the evolution of their climatic preferences. This lack of research is probably because their evolutionary ecology is thought to be primarily driven by their interactions with their host plants. Here, we use a robust phylogenetic framework and species-level distribution data for the conifer-feeding aphid genus Cinara to investigate the role of climatic adaptation in the diversity and distribution patterns of these host-specialized insects. Insect climate niches were reconstructed at a macroevolutionary scale, highlighting that climate niche tolerance is evolutionarily labile, with closely related species exhibiting strong climatic disparities. This result may suggest repeated climate niche differentiation during the evolutionary diversification of Cinara. Alternatively, it may merely reflect the use of host plants that occur in disparate climatic zones, and thus, in reality the aphid species' fundamental climate niches may actually be similar but broad. Comparisons of the aphids' current climate niches with those of their hosts show that most Cinara species occupy the full range of the climatic tolerance exhibited by their set of host plants, corroborating the hypothesis that the observed disparity in Cinara species' climate niches can simply mirror that of their hosts. However, 29% of the studied species only occupy a subset of their hosts' climatic zone, suggesting that some aphid species do indeed have their own climatic limitations. Our results suggest that in host-specialized phytophagous insects, host associations cannot always adequately describe insect niches and abiotic factors must be taken into account.",,,,"Favret, Colin/F-7726-2012","Favret, Colin/0000-0001-6243-3184; Arnal, Pierre/0000-0002-6799-2409; Sanchez Meseguer, Andrea/0000-0003-0743-404X",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,OCT,2019,9,20,,,,,11657,11671,,10.1002/ece3.5652,,OCT 2019,,,,,WOS:000488395400001,31695876,,,,,

Six alien species (Heterocope caspia, Calanipeda aquaedulcis, Eurytemora caspica, Cornigerius maeoticus maeoticus, Cercopagis pengoi, and Podonevadne trigona ovum) were recorded in the Volga reservoirs and three species (Heterocope caspia, Eurytemora caspica, and Cercopagis pengoi) were recorded in the Kama reservoirs. It was found first time that copepods Heterocope caspia and Eurytemora caspica spread and naturalized in the areas of all three Kama reservoirs (within the distance of 1000 km from the Volga River); the cladoceran Cercopagis pengoi formed a disrupted range with a group of habitats in the mouth part of the Kama River (55 degrees 12 '-55 degrees 26 ' N) and north near the city of Perm (57 degrees 53 '-58 degrees 26 ' N).

We examined the molecular evolution of 20 mutator lines selected for fast expansions (SEL) and compared them to 20 other mutator lines freely expanding without artificial selection (CONTROL). We find that the colony size of all 20 SEL lines have increased relative to the ancestral lines, unlike CONTROL lines, showing that enough beneficial mutations are produced during spatial expansions to counteract the negative effect of expansion load. Importantly, SEL and CONTROL lines have similar numbers of mutations indicating that they evolved for the same number of generations and that increased fitness is not due to a purging of deleterious mutations. We find that loss of function mutations better explain the increased colony size of SEL lines than nonsynonymous mutations or a combination of the two. Interestingly, most loss of function mutations are found in simple sequence repeats (SSRs) located in genes involved in gene regulation and gene expression.

In this study, we have incorporated genetic information with ENM to generate projected distribution of the invasive species Mikania micrantha for which two genetic clusters were identified in South and Southeast Asia. Climatic niches were compared between native and invasive ranges, as well as between invasive ranges of two lineages by using multivariate and univariate analyses. Ecological niche models were built with MaxEnt, using occurrence data of two lineages separately, together and also using native range data. Predictive abilities of the models were compared and potential distributions of the two lineages were predicted under present and future climate scenarios. The models were projected on the native range to identify climatically suitable areas for each lineage. Significant differences between climatic niches of the two invasive lineages were found and unique climatically suitable areas for each lineage were identified. A large area of South and Southeast Asia was found to be climatically suitable for both lineages. Under climate change scenarios, pole ward range expansion for one lineage and decrease in range size along marginal areas for another lineage were predicted. However, high amount of niche unfilling for both the lineages indicated that if introduced, the lineages can establish in cold and dry areas of the invasive range. The evidence of niche abandonment between native and invasive ranges indicated presence of other lineages in its native range which are not yet introduced in this region. These findings provided baseline data for implementing management strategies at early stage of invasion and quarantine measures to protect this region from future invasions. Climatically suitable areas in the native range were identified for both lineages which can be prioritized for conducting surveys for identification of source populations and biological control agents. Our study highlights the importance of integrating genetic data in future ENM approaches to have finer scale information of species' distribution, which can be utilized to develop region-specific and climate change-integrated management strategies for invasive species.

Invasive marmosets can hybridize with native congeners reducing the genetic integrity on native populations. However, no study quantified the spatial extent of these invasions and which species can be impacted by a hybridization process. Here, we predicted the range expansion and hence the potential geographic overlap between Callithrix species, particularly in Atlantic Forest and Cerrado, to discuss management strategies. We hypothesized that marmosets endemic to the Atlantic Forest are more threatened by invasive congeners than other marmosets. We generated species distribution models for six Callithrix species using four algorithms, six environmental layers and 445 georeferenced localities extracted from literature published since 2000. Suitability maps for each species were binarized using a 20-percentile threshold and overlapped to predict invasion and quantify hybridization potential risks. All Callithrix species had potential to expand their range within the Atlantic Forest although suitable habitats for C. flaviceps and C. kuhlii were more limited. C. jacchus and C. penicillata have already expanded their range to different biomes and our model shows that they can spread even further. The potential hybridization zones were identified within the distribution range of all species, and more markedly within Atlantic Forest species ranges. For assuring the ecosystem equilibriums, we urge to prevent the biological invasions and to control the human-induced Callithrix introductions and expansions within Neotropical hotspots.

The novel communities and species interactions that may arise during range shifts provide an opportunity to study fundamental ecological processes, while also addressing potential conservation issues. Black sea bass (Centropristis striata) historically ranged from the Gulf of Mexico to Cape Cod, but recently have expanded north into the Gulf of Maine. Very little is known about the impact of this range expansion on benthic community structure throughout the coastal waters of the Gulf of Maine. To investigate the effects of sea bass on the behavior of juvenile American lobsters (Homarus americanus), we manipulated the presence of sea bass olfactory cues and quantified shelter use and foraging behavior of lobsters from three regions in the Gulf of Maine with different potential contact histories with sea bass. Sea bass presence increased shelter usage and reduced foraging in lobsters, but contact history influenced the strength of these behavioral responses. Lobsters with no previous contact with sea bass did not significantly increase shelter usage or decrease movement in their presence but did reduce their foraging rate on mussels. This observed reduction in consumption indicates that naive lobsters recognize novel predators, but the ineffective anti-predator responses exhibited support the naive prey hypothesis. Meanwhile, lobsters with the longest potential contact history with sea bass significantly increased shelter usage when sea bass were present; however, they exhibited limited movement and foraging behavior in both the absence and presence of sea bass. Finally, lobsters with a short potential contact history with sea bass exhibited increased shelter usage, reduced movement, and reduced mussel consumption in the presence of sea bass, revealing that juvenile lobsters quickly adapt anti-predator defenses to avoid this novel threat. Overall, these results suggest that prey contact history with novel predators mediates the strength of their nonconsumptive effects, and consequently can influence geographic patterns in predator-prey dynamics.",,,,,"Grabowski, Jonathan/0000-0003-4711-5481",,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,OCT,2019,10,10,,,,,,,e02867,10.1002/ecs2.2867,,,,,,,WOS:000493528200026,,,,,,

Isolated populations exhibited small effective sizes and low dispersal rates that depended on water connectivity, suggesting that genetic drift dominated in the evolution of allele frequencies in these populations. We also observed a significant decrease in the genetic diversity of isolated populations over only a 2-year period, but failed to demonstrate an associated fitness cost using fluctuating asymmetry.

All these components can affect forest pests directly, or indirectly through interactions with host trees and natural enemies. Most of the responses of forest insect herbivores to climate change are expected to be positive, with shorter generation time, higher fecundity and survival, leading to increased range expansion and outbreaks. Forest insect pest can also benefit from synergistic effects of several climate change pressures, such as hotter droughts or warmer storms. However, lesser known negative effects are also likely, such as lethal effects of heat waves or thermal shocks, less palatable host tissues or more abundant parasitoids and predators. The complex interplay between abiotic stressors, host trees, insect herbivores and their natural enemies makes it very difficult to predict overall consequences of climate change on forest health.

This paper reports upon new data from IUP occupations at Wadi Aghar, a rock shelter site in the southern Levant. In combining the results of radiometric dates and lithic analyses, we clarify the chronological and cultural position of Wadi Aghar assemblages in the Levantine IUP. As for the records about mobility, on-site activities, and resource procurement behaviors, we present analyses of lithic use-wear, tool-type composition, soil micromorphology, and marine shells. The lithic analyses and the optically stimulated luminescence (and subsidiary radiocarbon) dating of the Wadi Aghar materials suggest their chronocultural position in the IUP (45-40 ka for Layers C-D1; 39-36 ka for Layer B; possibly 50 ka for Layer D2), providing the southernmost location for the IUP in Eurasia. In the Levant, Wadi Aghar represents one of the few IUP sites in the inland areas. The results also indicate that the timing and technological sequences from the IUP to the following bladelet industries differed between the inland and coastal zones, likely reflecting geographically variable adaptive behaviors and/or cultural transmissions. One of the behavioral characteristics of IUP foragers at Wadi Aghar is the procurement of remote resources, represented by the transportation of marine shells from the Red Sea: Canarium fusiforme and Canarium cf. mutabile. Whether it was a direct procurement with increased mobility or a result of intergroup exchanges, it was not part of behavioral repertoires during the late MP in the same area. This can be understood as the expansion of resource procurement range, functioning as additional buffers from risk in the semiarid environments in the inland Levant. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

African wild dogs Lycaon pictus are endangered, and reintroductions have become a routine part of range expansion in South Africa. Wild dogs form packs that are essential to their reproduction and survival, and artificial pack formation is often required before reintroduction. We examined the proximate (i.e. social integration) and ultimate (i.e. reproduction) success of 43 artificial pack formation attempts in the South African managed metapopulation, between 1995 and 2018. The top (and dominant) model for proximate success included an interaction between total group size and an initial separation fence. Larger groups took longer to integrate, irrespective of initial separation, whereas smaller groups brought together immediately integrated faster than those that were initially separated. The top models for ultimate success included an interaction between the proportion of males and number of days spent in the pre-release enclosure, the total number of days in the enclosure and an interaction between the proportion of captive-sourced individuals and the total number of days in the enclosure. Ultimate success increased when packs spent less time in the enclosure, especially if those packs had a low proportion of males (i.e. female biased) or included >25% captive-sourced individuals. Neither the size of the artificially created pack nor the season in which the pack was released affected ultimate success. The success of social integration and reproductive success of artificially formed packs in this study was higher than for natural pack formations. We provide guidelines for optimizing future artificial pack formation in wild dogs for reintroduction success.

Prey arriving from predator-free patches might also have evolved weaker defenses against predators and thus enhance trophic subsidies by providing easily captured prey. Using local models assuming a linear or accelerating trade-off between defense and population growth rate, we demonstrate that immigration of undefended prey increased predator abundances and decreased defended prey through eco-evolutionary apparent competition. In individual-based models with spatial structure, explicit genetics, and gene flow along an environmental gradient, prey became maladapted to predators at the predator's range edge, and greater gene flow enhanced this maladaptation. The predator gained a subsidy from these easily captured prey, which enhanced its abundance, facilitated its persistence in marginal habitats, extended its range extent, and enhanced range shifts during environmental changes, such as climate change. Once the predator expanded, prey adapted to it and the advantage disappeared, resulting in an elastic predator range margin driven by eco-evolutionary dynamics.

We investigated whether niche partitioning into upland and riparian habitats differentiates the range dynamics of two closely related and sympatric eastern Australian trees: the mountain water gum (Tristaniopsis collina) and the water gum (T. laurina). Using genomic data from SNP genotyping of 480 samples, we assessed the impact of biogeographic barriers and tested for signals of range expansion. Circuit theory was used to model isolation-by-resistance across three palaeo-environment scenarios: the Last Glacial Maximum, the Holocene Climate Optimum and present-day (1950-2014). Both trees showed similar genetic structure across historically dry barriers, despite evidence of significant environmental niche differentiation and different post-glacial habitat shifts. Tristaniopsis collina exhibits the signature of serial founder effects consistent with recent or rapid range expansion, whilst T. laurina has genetic patterns consistent with long-term persistence in geographically isolated populations despite occupying a broader bioclimatic niche. We found the minor influence of isolation-by-resistance on both species, though other unknown factors appear to shape genetic variation. We postulate that specialized recruitment traits (adapted to flood-disturbance regimes) rather than habitat availability limited post-glacial range expansion in T. laurina.

This biogeographic pattern has been hypothesized to be the result of transoceanic long-distance dispersal, Oligocene dispersal through forested corridors, Miocene dispersal through the Arabian Peninsula or passive dispersal on the rifting Indian plate. However, it has often been difficult to pinpoint the mechanisms at play. We investigate biotic exchange between the Afrotropics and the Oriental region during the Cenozoic, a period in which geological changes altered landmass connectivity. We use Baorini skippers (Lepidoptera, Hesperiidae) as a model, a widespread clade of butterflies in the Old World tropics with a disjunct distribution between the Afrotropics and the Oriental region. We use anchored phylogenomics to infer a robust evolutionary tree for Baorini skippers and estimate divergence times and ancestral ranges to test biogeographic hypotheses. Our phylogenomic tree recovers strongly supported relationships for Baorini skippers and clarifies the systematics of the tribe. Dating analyses suggest that these butterflies originated in the Oriental region, Greater Sunda Islands, and the Philippines in the early Miocene c. 23 Ma. Baorini skippers dispersed from the Oriental region towards Africa at least five times in the past 20 Ma. These butterflies colonized the Afrotropics primarily through trans-Arabian geodispersal after the closure of the Tethyan seaway in the mid-Miocene. Range expansion from the Oriental region towards the African continent probably occurred via the Gomphotherium land bridge through the Arabian Peninsula. Alternative scenarios invoking long-distance dispersal and vicariance are not supported.

Within this dynamic landscape, pathogens that excel at invading recently colonized host populations are not necessarily those that perform best in host populations at or near their carrying capacity, potentially giving rise to divergent selection for pathogen traits that mediate the invasion process. Rarely, however, has this contention been empirically tested. Using Daphnia magna, we explored how differences in the colonization history of a host population influence the invasion success of different genotypes of the pathogen Pasteuria ramosa. By partitioning the pathogen invasion process into a series of individual steps, we show that each pathogen optimizes invasion differently when encountering host populations that vary in their time since colonization. All pathogen genotypes were more likely to establish successfully in recently colonized host populations, but the production of transmission spores was typically maximized in either the subsequent growth or stationary phase of host colonization. Integrating across the first three pathogen invasion steps (initial establishment, proliferation, and secondary infection) revealed that overall pathogen invasion success (and its variance) was, nonetheless, highest in recently colonized host populations. However, only pathogens that were slow to kill their host were able to maximize host-facilitated dispersal. This suggests that only a subset of pathogen genotypes-the less virulent and more dispersive-are more likely to encounter newly colonized host populations at the front of a range expansion or in metapopulations with high extinction rates. Our results suggest a fundamental trade-off for a pathogen between dispersal and virulence, and evidence for higher invasion success in younger host populations, a finding with clear implications for pathogen evolution in spatiotemporally dynamic settings.",,,,"Phillips, Ben/C-7957-2009; Hall, Matthew/A-2006-2009","Phillips, Ben/0000-0003-2580-2336; Norgaard, Louise/0000-0002-0938-0017; Hall, Matthew/0000-0002-4738-203X",,,,,,,,,,,,,2056-3744,,,,OCT,2019,3,5,,,,,555,566,,10.1002/evl3.141,,SEP 2019,,,,,WOS:000487602000001,31636946,,,,,

Here, we assess the potential for intraspecific differentiation between and within lake populations of roach (Rutilus rutilus)-a widespread and abundant cyprinid species-in lakes in which salmonids have evolved endemic adaptive radiations. Based on more than 3,000 polymorphic RADseq markers, we detected low but significant genetic differentiation between roach populations of two ultraoligotrophic lakes and between these and populations from other lakes. This, together with differentiation in head morphology and stable isotope signatures, suggests evolutionary and ecological differentiation among some of our studied populations. Next, we tested for intralacustrine diversification of roach within Lake Brienz, the most pristine lake surveyed in this study. We found significant phenotypic evidence for ecological intralacustrine differentiation between roach caught over a muddy substrate and those caught over a rocky substrate. However, evidence for intralacustrine genetic differentiation is at best subtle and phenotypic changes may therefore be mostly plastic.

As climates change, species might move from one place to another, due to local extinctions and colonization of new environments. However, the existence of permeable migratory routes precedes faunal migrations in fragmented landscapes. Here, we investigate how dispersal will affect the outcome of climate change on the distribution of Amazon's primate species. We modeled the distribution of 80 Amazon primate species, using ecological niche models, and projected their potential distribution on scenarios of climate change. Then, we imposed landscape restrictions to primate dispersal, derived from a natural biogeographical barrier to primates (the main tributaries of the Amazon river) and an anthropogenic constraint to the migration of many canopy-dependent animals (deforested areas). We also highlighted potential conflict zones, i.e. regions of high migration potential but predicted to be deforested. Species response to climate change varied across dispersal limitation scenarios. If species could occupy all newly suitable climate, almost 70% of species could expand ranges. Including dispersal barriers (natural and anthropogenic), however, led to range expansion in only less than 20% of the studied species. When species were not allowed to migrate, all of them lost an average of 90% of the suitable area, suggesting that climate may become unsuitable within their present distributions. All Amazon primate species may need to move as climate changes to avoid deleterious effects of exposure to non-analog climates. The effect of climate change on the distribution of Amazon primates will ultimately depend on whether landscape permeability will allow climate-driven faunal migrations.

In particular, the relative role of disparate propagule sources and genetic adaptation through postintroduction hybridization has remained largely unexplored. To add resolution to this paradox, we investigate the genetic architecture responsible for the invasion of two invasive Asian carp species, bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (H. molitrix) (bigheaded carps) that experience extensive hybridization in the Mississippi River Basin (MRB). We sequenced the genomes of bighead and silver carps (similar to 1.08G bp and similar to 1.15G bp, respectively) and their hybrids collected from the MRB. We found moderate-to-high heterozygosity in bighead (0.0021) and silver (0.0036) carps, detected significantly higher dN/dS ratios of single-copy orthologous genes in bigheaded carps versus 10 other species of fish, and identified genes in both species potentially associated with environmental adaptation and other invasion-related traits. Additionally, we observed a high genomic similarity (96.3% in all syntenic blocks) between bighead and silver carps and over 90% embryonic viability in their experimentally induced hybrids. Our results suggest intrinsic genomic features of bigheaded carps, likely associated with life history traits that presumably evolved within their native ranges, might have facilitated their initial establishment of invasion, whereas ex-situ interspecific hybridization between the carps might have promoted their range expansion. This study reveals an alternative mechanism that could resolve one of the genetic paradoxes in biological invasions and provides invaluable genomic resources for applied research involving bigheaded carps.",,,,"Ling, Qufei/D-1690-2016; Zhu, Lifeng/AAK-8892-2020","Deng, Cao/0000-0001-9823-9121; Bernatchez, Louis/0000-0002-8085-9709",,,,,,,,,,,,1752-4571,,,,,FEB,2020,13,2,,,,,263,277,,10.1111/eva.12863,,SEP 2019,,,,,WOS:000486262700001,31993075,,,,,

Here, we investigate the recent range expansion of scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius) into Norway and clarify whether the genetic patterns indicate natural spread or human introduction. Furthermore, we investigate whether plants were moved within the native range and how this influences invasion success. We also infer the level and structuring of genetic diversity within and between the putative native and introduced range. Location Europe. Methods We analysed the chloroplast sequence variation in 267 scotch broom samples from its northern expansion front and from its native range across Europe, including herbarium samples dating back to 1835. For 37 populations, we analysed variation in nuclear single-nucleotide polymorphic markers to study gene flow and genetic diversity. Results We identified 20 different haplotypes, which lacked spatial and temporal distribution patterns in the recent expansion range in Norway. They also mostly lacked patterns across the native European range of scotch broom. The genetic diversity of nuclear genomic SNP markers across populations in the introduced range was similar to that of populations in the native range, with limited differentiation among populations. Main conclusions Scotch broom is alien to Norway and was introduced by humans on multiple occasions from diverse origins over a long period of time. High propagule pressure has probably maintained the high genetic diversity in the novel range through a combination of genetically diverse source populations and high gene flow among them. Within the native European range, our results suggest the presence of cryptic intraspecific admixture, most likely mediated by humans moving genotypes among the regions occupied by distinct native genotypes.

In some species, individuals might be able to adjust by learning from individual experiences and by copying others. This could greatly speed up the process of adjustment, but evidence from the wild is scarce. Here, we investigated the processes by which a rapidly growing population of barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) responded to strong environmental changes on spring-staging areas in Norway. One area, Helgeland, has been the traditional site. Since the mid-1990s, an increasing number of geese stage in another area 250 km further north, Vesteralen. We collected data on goose numbers and weather conditions from 1975 to 2017 to explore the extent to which the increase in population size and a warmer climate contributed to this change in staging area use. During the study period, the estimated onset of grass growth advanced on average by 0.54 days/year in each of the two areas. The total production of digestible biomass for barnacle geese during the staging period increased in Vesteralen but remained stable in Helgeland. The goose population has doubled in size during the past 25 years, with most of the growth being accommodated in Vesteralen. The observations suggest that this dramatic increase would not have happened without higher temperatures in Vesteralen. Records of individually marked geese indicate that from the initial years of colonization onwards, especially young geese tended to switch to Vesteralen, thereby predominating in the flocks at Vesteralen. Older birds had a lower probability of switching to Vesteralen, but over the years, the probability increased for all ages. Our findings suggest that barnacle geese integrate socially learned behaviour with adjustments to individual experiences, allowing the population to respond rapidly and accurately to global change.",,,,,"Tombre, Ingunn M./0000-0002-1229-5972",,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,NOV,2019,25,11,,,,,3680,3693,,10.1111/gcb.14793,,SEP 2019,,,,,WOS:000484831400001,31475774,,,,,

As hybrid vigor is short-lived, provisioning adaptation is anticipated to be the dominant and long-term profit of genetic admixture, but the evidence for this is rare. We employed the 30 years' geographic-scale invasion of the salt marsh grass, Spartina alterniflora, as an evolutionary experiment and evaluated the consequences of genetic admixture by combining the reciprocal transplant experiment with quantitative and population genetic surveys. Consistent with the documentation, we found that the invasive populations in China had multiple origins from the southern Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Mexico in the US. Interbreeding among these multiple sources generated a hybrid swarm that spread throughout the coast of China. In the northern and mid-latitude China, natural selection greatly enhanced fecundity, plant height and shoot regeneration compared to the native populations. Furthermore, genetic admixture appeared to have broken the negative correlation between plant height and shoot regeneration, which was genetically-based in the native range, and have facilitated the evolution of super competitive genotypes in the invasive range. In contrast to the evolved northern and mid-latitude populations, the southern invasive populations showed slight increase of plant height and shoot regeneration compared to the native populations, possibly reflecting the heterotic effect of the intraspecific hybridization. Therefore, our study suggests a critical role of genetic admixture in accelerating the geographic invasion via provisioning rapid adaptive evolution.",,,,,"Li, Qingshun/0000-0003-4105-1480",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-1083,1365-294X,,,,SEP,2019,28,17,,,,,4012,4027,,10.1111/mec.15192,,SEP 2019,,,,,WOS:000484825900001,31339595,,,,,

Wild sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) is native to North America and was introduced, and has become invasive, in several countries, including Argentina (ARG). Here, using classical population genetic analyses and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) modeling, we studied the invasion history of wild sunflower in ARG. We analyzed 115 individuals belonging to 15 populations from ARG (invasive range) and United States (US, native range) at 14 nuclear and 3 chloroplast simple sequence repeat markers along with 23 phenotypic variables. Populations from ARG showed similar levels of nuclear genetic diversity to US populations and higher genetic diversity in the chloroplast genome, indicating no severe genetic bottlenecks during the invasion process. Bayesian clustering analysis, based on nuclear markers, suggests the presence of 3 genetic clusters, all present in both US and ARG. Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) detected an overall low population structure between central US and ARG populations but separated 2 invasive populations from the rest. ABC modeling supports multiple introductions but also a southward dispersal within ARG. Genetic and phenotypic data support the central US as a source of introduction while the source of secondary introductions could not be resolved. Finally, using genetic markers from the chloroplast genome, we found lower population structure in ARG when compared with US populations, suggesting a role for seed-mediated gene flow in Argentina.",,,,"Hernandez, Fernando/AAA-7510-2021; Presotto, Alejandro/AAM-8995-2021","Hernandez, Fernando/0000-0001-5158-2029",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-1503,1465-7333,,,,SEP,2019,110,6,,,,,746,759,,10.1093/jhered/esz047,,,,,,,WOS:000493110700011,31353398,,,,,

The species was first documented in Dania Beach, Florida (northwestern Caribbean) in 1985. Since that time the species has expanded its range rapidly to the Northwestern Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea. Since its introduction P. volitans has changed community structure and biodiversity of Caribbean reef communities and other coastal tropical ecosystems. Continuous introductions (accidental or intentional), limited natural predators, naive-range prey behavior, high predation rates on competitors, continuous reproduction, and an extended period of larval dispersal have been the keys for successful invasion and rapid range extension of P. volitans. This invasion has become so severe that it has been recognized as one of the world's top conservation issues. Here, we review the life history, behavior, and historical and contemporary genetic patterns that facilitate expansion and the colonization process. A greater understanding of lionfish biology, ecology, and the changes related to its present condition as a super-invader could improve current and future management strategies and new detection and response methodologies. We also examine new invasion frontiers that this species has the potential to colonize such as the eastern Pacific. This information will provide managers, the scientific community, and the civil society better tools for eradication, control and management of future invasions of this and other invasive species.

Along the US Atlantic coast, the northward expanding foundation species, black mangrove Avicennia germinans, is replacing the dominant salt marsh foundation species, marsh cordgrass Spartina alterniflora. These species have distinct detrital attributes that ostensibly provide different resources to epifauna. We experimentally examined how detritus of these species affects decomposition and community composition in different habitat contexts at regional and local scales. First, we manipulated detritus identity (Avicennia, Spartina) at 13 sites across a 5 degrees latitudinal gradient spanning mangrove, mixed marsh-mangrove and salt marsh habitats. Across latitude, we found that Avicennia detritus decomposed 2-4 times faster than Spartina detritus, suggesting that detrital turnover will increase with mangrove expansion. Epifaunal abundance and richness increased 2-7 times from south to north (mangrove to salt marsh) and were equivalent between Avicennia and Spartina detritus except for crabs, a dominant taxonomic group that preferred Spartina detritus. Second, to examine the whether changing habitat context affected regional patterns, we manipulated detritus identity and surrounding habitat type (mangrove, salt marsh) at a single mixed site, also including inert mimics to separate structural and nutritional roles of detritus. Epifaunal richness was similar between the two detrital types, but crabs were 2-7 times more abundant in Spartina detritus due to its structural attributes. Surrounding habitat type did not influence decomposition rate or community patterns, which suggests that latitudinal influences, not surrounding habitat, drove the regional community patterns in the first experiment. Overall, mangrove expansion could alter epifaunal communities due to the lower structural value and faster turnover of mangrove detritus. As species shift with changing climate, understanding foundation species substitutability is critical to predict community change, but we must account for concomitant environmental changes that also modify communities.",,,,,"Smith, Rachel/0000-0002-8713-126X; Byers, James/0000-0001-9240-0287",,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,SEP,2019,128,9,,,,,1367,1380,,10.1111/oik.06149,,,,,,,WOS:000483708700013,,,,,,

Here, we focused on the growth rate and age structure at the range edge vs. the range core in an expanding population of X. laevis. We used skeletochronology to characterize the age of 250 individuals captured at the range core and edge of this expanding population. Using the Von Bertalanffy equation, we then compared individual growth rates between locations. We found no significant changes in growth rate or age structure between edge and core samples.

Expansion is primarily driven by reproduction and dispersal, but nature abounds with examples of evolution where organisms pay a reproductive cost to disperse faster. When does selection favor this survival of the fastest? We searched for a simple rule, motivated by evolution experiments where swarming bacteria evolved into a hyperswarmer mutant that disperses similar to 100% faster but pays a growth cost of similar to 10% to make many copies of its flagellum. We analyzed a two-species model based on the Fisher equation to explain this observation: the population expansion rate (v) results from an interplay of growth (r) and dispersal (D) and is independent of the carrying capacity: v = 2 ( rD ) 1 / 2 . A mutant can take over the edge only if its expansion rate (v (2)) exceeds the expansion rate of the established species (v (1)); this simple condition ( v 2 > v 1 ) determines the maximum cost in slower growth that a faster mutant can pay and still be able to take over. Numerical simulations and time-course experiments where we tracked evolution by imaging bacteria suggest that our findings are general: less favorable conditions delay but do not entirely prevent the success of the fastest.

Although the species now occurs in a much wider range of climates than before the range expansion, the fastest growing populations in the northwest are in regions with minimum breeding season temperatures similar to those occupied by the species in its native range. Range expansions in the Anna's hummingbird thus reflect an ecological release likely caused by a mix of introduced plants, human facilitation, and phenological acclimation that allowed a California native to expand across western North America.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0147,1537-5323,,,,SEP 1,2019,194,3,,,,,306,315,,10.1086/704249,,,,,,,WOS:000482091000004,31553208,,,,,

Here we examine how a particular pattern of temporal variation-periodic pulses of immigration-influences adaptation to a harsh environment, in which a species experiences conditions outside its niche requirements. Using both deterministic models and stochastic individual-based simulations, we show that for many ecological and genetic scenarios, temporally spacing out immigration events increases the probability that local adaptation is sufficient for persistence (i.e., niche evolution). When immigration events are too frequent, gene flow can hamper local adaptation in sexual species, but sufficiently infrequent pulses of immigration allow for repeated opportunities for adaptation with temporary escapes from gene flow during which local selection is unleashed. We develop versions of our models with and without density dependence for three different assumptions about the genetics underlying fitness (haploid, diploid, and quantitative genetic variation) so that our results may be applicable to a wide range of natural systems. Our study adds to a growing body of literature showing that temporal variation in migration rates can have significant effects on local adaptation and is among the first to show how such variation affects niche evolution.",,,,,"Peniston, James/0000-0003-3577-1035",,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0147,1537-5323,,,,SEP 1,2019,194,3,,,,,316,333,,10.1086/704608,,,,,,,WOS:000482091000005,31553211,,,,,

Today, this genus has a circumtropical distribution, with representatives found in Asia, Oceania, Africa and the Neotropics. However, its geographical origin and the historical events behind its rapid diversification and global radiation are still debated. Here, we inferred the evolution of a set of life traits that aid in dispersal and how they influenced the biogeography of Crocodylus. Location Global. Time period Cretaceous to the present. Major taxa studied Crocodylidae. Methods We estimated biogeographical history on a published phylogeny using probabilistic biogeography models. Next, we identified four life traits likely to promote range expansion and used a trait-based dispersal model jointly to infer evolution of these traits and their influence on the dispersal of crocodilians. Finally, we used diversification analyses to identify shifts in diversification rates. Results An Asian origin was reconstructed for Crocodylus. Despite the small size of the phylogeny, statistical model comparison reports substantially improved the model fit of trait-dependent over trait-independent dispersal models. In individual tests, the four life traits considered (salt tolerance, large size, large clutches and habitat generalism) appear to be correlated statistically with higher dispersal probabilities. However, the traits are likely to be correlated with each other, and we hypothesize that they all reflect the gradual evolution of a range-expansion phenotype in early Crocodylus that resulted in increased diversification of the clade. Main conclusions Increased dispersal in the genus Crocodylus was associated with the gradual evolution of a range-expansion phenotype. Interestingly, the evolution of the range-expansion phenotype was also associated with the diversification of the genus in a period of global crocodilian extinction, indicating that range expansion might have served as a potential driver of speciation. This suggests that the concept of spatial sorting, normally applied at the population genetic level at the leading edge of an expanding population, might also act on a macroevolutionary scale.",,,,"Matzke, Nicholas/L-4109-2015","Matzke, Nicholas/0000-0002-8698-7656; Nicolai, Michael/0000-0002-9570-0311",,,,,,,,,,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,,,SEP,2019,28,9,,,,,1244,1258,,10.1111/geb.12929,,,,,,,WOS:000480584900004,,,,,,

It is therefore important to simultaneously study the impacts of global warming on interdependent taxa from different trophic levels. Here, we quantify current and potential future associations of functional diversity (based on multiple traits) and functional identity (based on individual traits) between interacting taxa using projection models under climate change. Location A tropical elevational gradient (500-3,500 m a.s.l.) in the Manu biosphere reserve, south-east Peru. Methods We investigated different scenarios of how species' elevational ranges might change under climate change based on projected future increases in mean annual temperature and current associations of species' elevational ranges with temperature. We computed the functional diversity and identity of current and potential future plant and bird communities based on morphological traits that have been shown to be important for plant-frugivore interactions. Finally, we tested for changes in the associations between projected functional diversity and identity of future plant and bird communities. Results Projected functional diversity of plants and birds decreased under range contraction and range shift scenarios at low elevations. At mid- and high elevations, functional diversity of both species groups increased most strongly under range expansion. Correspondence between plant and bird functional diversity was weakest under range contraction, while it remained strong under range expansion and shift. Similarly, the correspondence of projected plant and bird functional identity was weakest under a range contraction scenario. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that a scenario in which species are dispersal-limited and sensitive to increasing temperatures is likely to cause a functional mismatch between plant and bird communities along this tropical elevational gradient. This implies that certain functional types of plants could miss avian seed dispersers in the future.

Its invasion success and extreme speed of range expansion has been partially attributed to weak control of its populations by natural enemies. Previously published data on emergence rates of the hymenopteran parasitoid Dinocampus coccinellae support the enemy release hypothesis: H. axyridis has been consistently less successfully parasitized compared to native ladybird species. In this study, we show that since 2016, i.e., 10 years after its arrival in Central Europe, several populations of H. axyridis in the Czech Republic have a very high prevalence of D. coccinellae parasitism. D. coccinellae emerged from 46% of H. axyridis individuals in the most parasitized population. Moreover, H. axyridis was more parasitized than the native Coccinella septempunctata in seven of nine investigated co-occurring populations. The meta-analytically pooled estimate of D. coccinellae emergence rate from H. axyridis across the Czech populations (this study) is thirteen times higher than the pooled estimate for invasive populations of this beetle elsewhere (historical data up to 2016). We hypothesize that some Central European populations of D. coccinellae have evolved to overcome the immune system of H. axyridis, which was previously thought to be responsible for the high larval mortality of D. coccinellae.

This process can promote the evolution of self-fertilization, but implicating historical processes as drivers of trait evolution is often difficult and requires an explicit model of biogeographic history. In plants, contemporary limits to outcrossing are often invoked as evolutionary drivers of self-fertilization, but historical expansions may shape mating system diversity, with leading-edge populations evolving elevated selfing ability. In a widespread plant, Campanula americana, we identified a glacial refugium in the southern Appalachian Mountains from spatial patterns of genetic drift among 24 populations. Populations farther from this refugium have smaller effective sizes and fewer rare alleles. They also displayed elevated heterosis in among-population crosses, reflecting the accumulation of deleterious mutations during range expansion. Although populations with elevated heterosis had reduced segregating mutation load, the magnitude of inbreeding depression lacked geographic pattern. The ability to self-fertilize was strongly positively correlated with the distance from the refugium and mutation accumulation-a pattern that contrasts sharply with contemporary mate and pollinator limitation.

We characterized the population structure of the endemic ringed salamander (Ambystoma annulatum) across its distribution in the Central Interior Highlands (CIH) of North America, an area of high species endemism, to infer the ecological and evolutionary history of the species. Methods We sampled 498 individuals across the species distribution and characterized the population genetic structure using nuclear microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers. Results Ambystoma annulatum exist in two strongly supported nuclear genetic clusters across the CIH that correspond to a northern cluster that includes the Missouri Ozark populations and a southern cluster that includes the Arkansas and Oklahoma Ozarks and the Ouachita Mountains. Our demographic models estimated that these populations diverged approximately 2,700 years ago. Pairwise estimates of genetic differentiation at microsatellite and mtDNA markers indicated limited contemporary gene flow and suggest that genetic differentiation was primarily influenced by changes in the post-Pleistocene landscape of the CIH. Main Conclusions Both the geologic history and post-European settlement history of the CIH have influenced the population genetic structure of A. annulatum. The low mtDNA diversity suggests a retraction into and expansion out of refugial areas in the south-central Ozarks, during temperature fluctuations of the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs. Similarly, the estimated divergence time for the two nuclear clusters corresponds to changes in the post-Pleistocene landscape. More recently, decreased A. annulatum gene flow may be a result of increased habitat fragmentation and alteration post-European settlement.",,,,"Eggert, Lori/AAC-3956-2019; Burkhart, Jacob/AAI-5486-2020","Burkhart, Jacob/0000-0002-7913-6220; Puckett, Emily/0000-0002-9325-4629",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,OCT,2019,9,19,,,,,11171,11184,,10.1002/ece3.5619,,AUG 2019,,,,,WOS:000483989100001,31641463,,,,,

Nonetheless, while preventing the introduction of non-native species from outside, Antarctica has received increasing research attention, the movement of species within and between Antarctic biogeographic regions remains largely unexplored. Within a biogeographical framework, we attempt to disentangle the role of abiotic and movement factors leading to potential range expansion in the Antarctic Peninsula of two native Collembola: Cryptopygus antarcticus and Folsomotoma octooculata. We found that, although locations exist with similar abiotic conditions to those already occupied by both species in non-colonised areas of the Antarctic Peninsula, connectivity via wind to these currently unoccupied areas is smaller than that between present occurrences. Thus, wind transport might result in range expansion very sporadically. Meanwhile, we found that human-influenced sites at the north-eastern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula had similar climates to locations where both species are currently found.

Understanding how invasive disease vectors rapidly evolve to novel conditions-particularly at the edge of its non-native range-has important implications for mitigating the prevalence and spread of disease. Here, we evaluate the role of local adaptation in overwintering capability of the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus. This species invaded the Southern United States in the 1980s and rapidly spread northward into novel climate compared to its native range. Photoperiodically induced egg diapause is a key trait contributing to the establishment and spread of Ae. albopictus in temperate latitudes, and diapause incidence rapidly developed a cline along a latitudinal gradient in the United States shortly after its initial invasion. However, variation in overwintering survival of diapause-induced eggs along this gradient is not known, but is critical to the fitness-related role of diapause evolution in the establishment of Ae. albopictus in its northern US range. Using reciprocal transplants, we detected local adaptation in overwinter survival of diapausing Aedes albopictus eggs. In northern range-edge winters, eggs produced by range-edge individuals survived better than those produced by range-core individuals. Diapause eggs from range-edge and range-core locations survived equally well in range-core winters, and no eggs survived a winter beyond the current northern range limit in the United States. Synthesis and applications. These results demonstrate rapid (similar to 3 decades) local adaptation of egg diapause, a key trait facilitating overwinter survival and range expansion for the invasive Asian tiger mosquito. In light of these results, control efforts could shift from targeting satellite populations to a focus on preventing dispersal into locally adapted, range-edge locations and to aim removal efforts towards areas surrounding locally adapted populations. Adopting new approaches to target rapidly adapting populations will require large-scale collaboration among control agencies and research institutions, and should begin in the northern US range to better control Aedes albopictus mosquito populations in the face of rapid adaptation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,NOV,2019,56,11,,,,,2518,2527,,10.1111/1365-2664.13480,,AUG 2019,,,,,WOS:000482366900001,,,,,,

Expansion of commodity crops, such as oil palm, fragments natural habitat areas, and strategies are needed to improve habitat connectivity in agricultural landscapes. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) voluntary certification system requires that growers identify and conserve forest patches identified as High Conservation Value Areas (HCVAs) before oil palm plantations can be certified as sustainable. We assessed the potential benefits of these conservation set-asides for forest connectivity. We mapped HCVAs and quantified their forest cover in 2015. To assess their contribution to forest connectivity, we modelled range expansion of forest-dependent populations with five dispersal abilities spanning those representative of poor dispersers (e.g. flightless insects) to more mobile species (e.g. large birds or bats) across 70 plantation landscapes in Borneo. Because only 21% of HCVA area was forested in 2015, these conservation set-asides currently provide few connectivity benefits. Compared to a scenario where HCVAs contain no forest (i.e. a no-RSPO scenario), current HCVAs improved connectivity by similar to 3% across all dispersal abilities. However, if HCVAs were fully reforested, then overall landscape connectivity could improve by similar to 16%. Reforestation of HCVAs had the greatest benefit for poor to intermediate dispersers (0.5-3 km per generation), generating landscapes that were up to 2.7 times better connected than landscapes without HCVAs. By contrast, connectivity benefits of HCVAs were low for highly mobile populations under current and reforestation scenarios, because range expansion of these populations was generally successful regardless of the amount of forest cover. Synthesis and applications. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) requires that High Conservation Value Areas (HCVAs) be set aside to conserve biodiversity, but HCVAs currently provide few connectivity benefits because they contain relatively little forest. However, reforested HCVAs have the potential to improve landscape connectivity for some forest species (e.g. winged insects), and we recommend active management by plantation companies to improve forest quality of degraded HCVAs (e.g. by enrichment planting).

Transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic modifications was highlighted focusing on its influence on microevolution of the invasive plant species.

However, a new environment and interactions with unfamiliar herbivores may impose selection on invading plants for traits that reduce their attractiveness to herbivores or for enhanced defenses compared to native host plants, leading to a pattern similar to enemy release but driven by evolutionary change rather than ecological differences. The Shifting Defense Hypothesis posits that plants in novel habitats will shift from specialized defense mechanisms to defense mechanisms effective against generalist herbivores in the new range. We tested these ideas by comparing herbivore preference and performance of native (Eurasia)- and invasive (New World)-range Medicago polymorpha, using a generalist herbivore, the soybean looper, that co-occurs with M. polymorpha in its New World invaded range. We found that soybean loopers varied in preference and performance depending on host genotype and that overall the herbivore preferred to consume plant genotypes from naive populations from Eurasia. This potentially suggests that range expansion of M. polymorpha into the New World has led to rapid evolution of a variety of traits that have helped multiple populations become established, including those that may allow invasive populations to resist herbivory. Thus, enemy release in a novel range can occur through rapid evolution by the plant during invasion, as predicted by the Shifting Defense Hypothesis, rather than via historical divergence.",,,,,"Jack, Chandra/0000-0003-0167-1271; Friesen, Maren/0000-0002-4274-8928",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,SEP,2019,9,18,,,,,10522,10533,,10.1002/ece3.5572,,AUG 2019,,,,,WOS:000481361300001,31632647,,,,,

Accounting for changes in climatic niche over time may provide better understanding of the dynamic biological invasion process. We investigated these changes for an invasive alien plant Mikania micrantha in South and Southeast Asia, Australia, Oceania and parts of the USA. Based on documented occurrences over 200 years (1800-2017), we reconstructed the introduction history of the species and estimated climatic niche dynamics for the presumed invasion routes. We estimated niche conservatism and the environmental analogy between native and invasive ranges and used ecological niche modeling to identify the potential distribution of M. micrantha under current and future climate change scenarios. Our study identified six pathways through which the species was presumably introduced from its native range. Climatic conditions of the initial introduction sites were found to be similar to those in the native niche. However, the species occupied climatic niches in dry and cold areas over time, being outside of the limits of the realized climatic niche of its native range. The climatic niche dynamics also differed between the invasion pathways with variable time lag. This pattern of niche change over time was found to be consistent in future. Nearly 20% of the invasive range was found to be climatically suitable for this species and was predicted to expand toward cold and dry areas of the invasive range affecting nearly half of the global biodiversity hotspots. By analyzing M. micrantha invasion at a time scale, this study revealed multiple introduction pathways, variation in climatic niche dynamics among invasion routes, and potential range expansion of the species in its invasive range. Although further experimental and molecular studies are needed to explain these findings fully, this study highlights the need for temporally explicit approaches toward better understanding and successful management of biological invasions.",,,,"BANERJEE, ACHYUT/AAC-1075-2020","BANERJEE, ACHYUT/0000-0001-7631-5269; Mukherjee, Abhishek/0000-0002-5277-1363",,,,,,,,,,,,2296-701X,,,,,AUG 6,2019,7,,,,,,,,291,10.3389/fevo.2019.00291,,,,,,,WOS:000479066600001,,,,,,

During such range expansions, plant species are expected to experience changes in interactions with other organisms, especially with belowground biota that have a limited dispersal capacity. Nematodes form a key component of the belowground food web as they include bacterivores, fungivores, omnivores and root herbivores. However, their community composition under climate change-driven intracontinental range-expanding plants has been studied almost exclusively under controlled conditions, whereas little is known about actual patterns in the field. Here, we use novel molecular sequencing techniques combined with morphological quantification in order to examine nematode communities in the rhizospheres of four rangeexpanding and four congeneric native species along a 2,000 km latitudinal transect from South-Eastern to North-Western Europe. We tested the hypotheses that latitudinal shifts in nematode community composition are stronger in range-expanding plant species than in congeneric natives and that in their new range, range-expanding plant species accumulate fewest root-feeding nematodes. Our results show latitudinal variation in nematode community composition of both range expanders and native plant species, while operational taxonomic unit richness remained the same across ranges. Therefore, range-expanding plant species face different nematode communities at higher latitudes, but this is also the case for widespread native plant species. Only one of the four range-expanding plant species showed a stronger shift in nematode community composition than its congeneric native and accumulated fewer root-feeding nematodes in its new range.

Globally, landscape alterations have resulted in declines to migratory populations across taxa. Given the long time periods over which migrations evolved in native systems, it is unlikely that restored populations embody the same migratory complexity that existed before population reductions or regional extirpation. We used GPS location data collected from 209 female bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) to characterize population and individual migration patterns along elevation and geographic continuums for 18 populations of bighorn sheep with different management histories (i.e., restored, augmented, and native) across the western United States. Individuals with resident behaviors were present in all management histories. Elevational migrations were the most common population-level migratory behavior. There were notable differences in the degree of individual variation within a population across the three management histories. Relative to native populations, restored and augmented populations had less variation among individuals with respect to elevation and geographic migration distances. Differences in migratory behavior were most pronounced for geographic distances, where the majority of native populations had a range of variation that was 2-4 times greater than restored or augmented populations. Synthesis and applications. Migrations within native populations include a variety of patterns that translocation efforts have not been able to fully recreate within restored and augmented populations. Theoretical and empirical research has highlighted the benefits of migratory diversity in promoting resilience and population stability. Limited migratory diversity may serve as an additional factor limiting demographic performance and range expansion.

Such data, however, may be prone to biases or inaccuracies - in particular, the over-reporting of novel species and under-reporting of common or mundane species. Few studies have assessed the relationship between unstructured and structured observations using long-term data. We compared 69 years of voluntary bird sightings, recorded in the regular publication of Peterborough Field Naturalists (PFN), 1948-2016, to systematic Christmas Bird Counts (CBC; during winter) and Breeding Bird Surveys (BBS; during spring) in central Ontario, Canada. We focused on seven species that had expanded their ranges into the area: Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), House Finch (Haemorhous mexicanus), Purple Finch (Haemorhous purpureus), Red-bellied Woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus), Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), Canada Goose (Branta canadensis), and American Robin (Turdus migratorius). For each species, we compared the first record, the annual number of sightings, and the annual relative abundance from the PFN to the first record and annual relative abundance in the CBC and BBS. We anticipated that naturalists' accounts would be more sensitive to the arrival of novel species but would underestimate abundance as the species became common. In general, our results agreed with these predictions. In 11 of 12 cases, the naturalists detected a species well in advance of the CBC and BBS - on average by 1 1/2 decades (range: 5-33 years). The correlations in bird abundance between unstructured (PFN) and structured (CBC and BBS) data were variable; most were weak and negative. We found significant negative correlations for the two most common species, Northern Cardinal (winter) and House Finch (spring), as well as for Wild Turkey (winter), and a positive correlation for the rarest species, the Red-bellied Woodpecker (spring). We surmise that novelty underlies these results - that rarity increases the likelihood of reporting by non-professionals.

Using mangrove tree data collected from Earth's largest permanent sample plot network at four historical time points (1986, 1994, 1999 and 2014), this study establishes spatially explicit baseline biodiversity information for the Sundarbans. We determined the spatial and temporal differences in alpha, beta, and gamma diversity in three ecological zones (hypo-, meso-, and hypersaline) and also uncovered changes in the mangroves' overall geographic range and abundances therein. Spatially, the hyposaline mangrove communities were the most diverse and heterogeneous in species composition while the hypersaline communities were the least diverse and most homogeneous at all historical time points. Since 1986, we detect an increasing trend of compositional homogeneity (between-site similarity in species composition) and a significant spatial contraction of distinct and diverse areas over the entire ecosystem. Temporally, the western and southern hypersaline communities have undergone radical shifts in species composition due to population increase and range expansion of the native invasive species Ceriops decandra and local extinction or range contraction of specialists including the globally endangered Heritiera fomes.

We compared the upper elevational distributional limit of each species when growing on vs. away from A. selago to test how the interaction with this cushion plant species affects species' ranges. Three out of 19 vascular plant species occurred at higher altitudes in the presence of A. selago than in the absence of A. selago: Acaena magellanica (+26 m higher), Colobanthus kerguelensis (+37 m higher), and Lycopodium saururus (+19 m higher). Therefore, A. selago's fine-scale impacts scaled up to shape the distribution of a subset of the vascular flora of Marion Island.

This is because, unless models impose reductions in carrying capacity at species' edges, the dominant effect of gene flow is to increase genetic variance and adaptive potential rather than swamping local adaptation. This allows the population to match even very steep changes in trait optima. We extend our previous simulations to explore two nonlinear models of ecological gradients: (a) a sigmoid (steepening) gradient and (b) a linear gradient with a flat centre of variable width. We compare the parameter conditions that allow local adaptation and range expansion from the centre, with those that permit the persistence of a perfectly adapted population distributed across the entire range. Along nonlinear gradients, colonization is easier, and extinction rarer, than along a linear gradient. This is because the shallow environmental gradient near the range centre does not cause gene flow to increase genetic variation, and so does not result in reduced population density. However, as gradient steepness increases, gene flow inflates genetic variance and reduces local population density sufficiently that genetic drift overcomes local selection, creating a finite range margin. When a flat centre is superimposed on a linear gradient, gene flow increases genetic variation dramatically at its edges, leading to an abrupt reduction in density that prevents niche expansion. Remarkably local interruptions in a linear ecological gradient (of a width much less than the mean dispersal distance) can prevent local adaptation beyond this flat centre. In contrast to other situations, this effect is stronger and more consistent where carrying capacity is high. Practically speaking, this means that habitat improvement at patch margins will make evolutionary rescue more likely. By contrast, even small improvements in habitat at patch centres may confine populations to limited areas of ecological space.",,,,"Kawata, Masakado/E-3962-2012; Butlin, Roger/F-7709-2013","Butlin, Roger/0000-0003-4736-0954; Bridle, Jonathan/0000-0002-5999-0307",,,,,,,,,,,,1752-4571,,,,,AUG,2019,12,7,,,SI,,1449,1462,,10.1111/eva.12789,,,,,,,WOS:000480580300016,31417626,,,,,

These species are the main reservoir for the most commonly rabies virus found in bats in Europe: the European bat Lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV-1). We used mtDNA and nuclear microsatellite markers to confirm the taxonomic status of both species and to show a more pronounced and geographically based genetic structure in E. isabellinus than in its sibling E. serotinus. Using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), we inferred rapid range expansion in both species after the Last Glacial Maximum until reaching their present distributions. ABC analysis also supported interspecific differences in genetic diversity and structure, pointing to an earlier expansion of E. isabellinus northward. We found no evidence of mitochondrial introgression between species, but nuclear markers identified a male-mediated ongoing asymmetric hybridization from E. isabellinus to E. serotinus (28% hybrids in E. serotinus and 5% in E. isabellinus) in the contact zone.

Understanding these changes is of crucial importance to predict the future changes in distribution ranges, and the possible impacts of expanding species on the colonized environments. Both theoretical and empirical studies have provided some evidence for an increased dispersal at the range edge of expanding populations. Because this phenomenon has been documented on large spatial scales, it seems difficult to determine what proportion of the phenotypic variation is due to the expansion process (spatial sorting) versus spatial variation in the environment (local adaptation). The aim of our study is to determine whether, in a small and recent expanding population, the dispersal capacity is increased at the range edge compared to the range core despite a minimal role of local adaptation. We studied the modification of dispersal capacity at the range edge of an expanding population of the African clawed frog, Xenopuslaevis recently settled in Western France. To do so, we used experiments to compare movements of individuals depending on their location in the population, and capture-mark-recapture field surveys to estimate variation in traits related to dispersal across the invasive range. Both methods consistently showed significantly higher dispersal rates and distances, as well as in the relative length of the hind limb, at the range edge, for both sexes. This result is the first report suggesting that changes in allocation to dispersal, and not only traits associated with dispersal, can occur at a small geographical and temporal scale, where the role of local adaptation is likely minimal.

In addition, we performed a selection experiment to increase survival of the beetles on the normal host and explored the consequences for life history and host-related traits and the corresponding G-matrix. After three selection events, we observed an improvement of survival in the selection line, but no correlational selection on other traits. There was also evidence that the G-matrix structure changed after selection. The genetic correlations between fecundity and relative growth rate and consumption efficiency were negative in the selection line, but neutral in the control line. The change in genetic correlations after selection suggests that there are trade-offs between survival and host utilization traits, which have the potential to limit the beetles' co-adaptation to evolving plant defenses.",,,,"Bustos-Segura, Carlos/AAF-2564-2020","Bustos-Segura, Carlos/0000-0002-8624-3251",,,,,,,,,,,,1872-8855,1872-8847,,,,AUG,2019,13,4,,,,,635,645,,10.1007/s11829-018-09669-6,,,,,,,WOS:000474364200008,,,,,,

Rapid adaptation to climate during range expansion has been recently recognised as a major factor in biological invasions. In this study, by using complementary approaches (common garden studies and the presence of parallel geographic clines), we tested for rapid, adaptive evolution of seed traits in wild sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). Seeds from 22 wild sunflower populations from native (North America) and invasive (Argentina and Australia) groups were grown in a common garden for 2years (experiments) and used for evaluating genetic differences in seed traits. Seed germination at two times after harvest, seed mass, and size (length and width) were recorded. In addition, 25 climatic variables were used to characterize the local environment of each population and to evaluate the geographic variation in the traits. Seeds from the invasive group showed larger mass and size and higher germination (lower seed dormancy) than seeds from the native group. Latitudinal cline explained most of the group variation in seed dormancy, but not in seed mass or size. Invasive sunflower from Argentina (but not from Australia) re-established the latitudinal cline observed in the native group. We provide evidence that support rapid, adaptive evolution (<70years) of seed dormancy in the invasive Argentinean sunflower in response to warmer environments found in Argentina, suggesting that crop wild relatives can quickly evolve in response to novel abiotic conditions.",,,,"Hernandez, Fernando/AAA-7510-2021; Presotto, Alejandro/AAM-8995-2021","Presotto, Alejandro/0000-0002-9085-9673; Hernandez, Fernando/0000-0001-5158-2029",,,,,,,,,,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,,,AUG,2019,21,8,,,,,2599,2612,,10.1007/s10530-019-01998-8,,,,,,,WOS:000474369500008,,,,,,

Faucet snails alter native community dynamics and are an intermediate host for multiple trematode parasites that can be lethal to waterfowl when the snails are consumed. Although faucet snails have been established in the Great Lakes for over a century, their populations appear to have remained small for most of this period and their known distribution was limited to the lower Great Lakes, though basin-wide surveys were lacking until recently, so snails may have gone undetected. We compiled data from a five-year coastal wetland monitoring program spanning all of the Great Lakes, providing a basin-wide inventory of faucet snail populations and confirming the snail's presence in every Great Lake. Further, we identified potential drivers of faucet snail occurrence and abundance (individuals per sampling replicate) across the basin and within individual lakes to identify factors that could lead to elevated risk of range expansion. Across the basin and within individual lakes, faucet snail occurrence was related to human recreational transport (proximity to a boat launch) and eutrophication (anthropogenic land-use, elevated nutrient concentrations). In addition, at sites where faucet snails occurred, they were most abundant at wetlands with surrounding forest cover, suggesting that the species can thrive in a range of environmental conditions. Our results suggest that limiting passive transport of faucet snails is vital to minimizing their spread to remote wetlands where the snails may thrive once established.",,,,,"Moerke, Ashley/0000-0003-3640-1159",,,,,,,,,,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,,,AUG,2019,21,8,,,,,2613,2628,,10.1007/s10530-019-02000-1,,,,,,,WOS:000474369500009,,,,,,

Two non-exclusive mechanisms, phenotypic plasticity and rapid adaptation, have often been used to explain the colonization and range expansion of invasive plants in novel habitats, but whether they are still applicable under altered environmental conditions such as N addition remains unclear. Here, we focused on a weedy plant, Plantago virginica, which is native to North America that invaded China. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to compare the differences in phenotypic traits (e.g., biomass, leaf traits and reproductive output) and plasticity between multiple native and invasive populations subjected to high and low nutrient availability. We found that the invasive populations differentiated from native ones for a suite of traits, suggesting that rapid adaptation may have occurred in the invasive species. In particular, plants of invasive populations were larger and produced significantly more seeds per inflorescence and individual than their native counterparts. The traits measured in both invasive and native populations exhibited a large degree of plasticity in response to altered N supply, indicating a master-of some superiority of P. virginica. Meanwhile, the leaf area and belowground biomass of invasive populations at vegetative stage had a higher degree of plasticity than those of the native populations. Our results suggest that both phenotypic plasticity and rapid adaptation may jointly explain the advantages of invasive plants in N-rich environments, thereby increasing the risk of biological invasions under N deposition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,,,AUG,2019,21,8,,,,,2679,2692,,10.1007/s10530-019-02004-x,,,,,,,WOS:000474369500014,,,,,,

For this reason, although hundreds of ant species have expanded their ranges through human transport, few obligate social parasites have done so. We test the hypothesis that social parasites expand their ranges more slowly than their hosts by examining the spread of an introduced social parasite-host species pair in North America-the workerless ant Tetramorium atratulum and the pavement ant T. immigrans. In doing so we report a new range extension of T. atratulum in the interior US. Consistent with host limitation on dispersal, we found a time lag ranging from several years to over a century between the arrivals of the host and parasite to a new region. The estimated maximum rate of range expansion in the parasite was only a third as fast as that of the host.

However, the species divergence and spatiotemporal population dynamics of alpine cold-tolerant herbal plants in the high-altitude Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and adjacent areas remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated population evolutionary history of four endangered Notopterygium herb species in the QTP and adjacent regions. We sequenced 10 nuclear loci, 2 mitochondrial DNA regions, and 4 chloroplast DNA regions in a total of 72 natural populations from the 4 species, and tested the hypothesis that the population history of these alpine herbs was markedly affected by the Miocene-Pliocene QTP uplifts and Quaternary climatic oscillations. We found that the four Notopterygium species had generally low levels of nucleotide variability within populations. Molecular dating and isolation-with-migration analyses suggested that Notopterygium species diverged similar to 1.74-7.82 million years ago and their differentiation was significantly associated with recent uplifts of the eastern margin of the QTP. In addition, ecological niche modeling and population history analysis showed that N. incisum and N. franchetii underwent considerable demographic expansions during the last glacial period of the Pleistocene, whereas a demographic contraction and a expansion occurred for N. forrestii and N. oviforme during the antepenultimate interglacial period and penultimate glacial period, respectively.

To understand ecophysiological traits that will impact geographical range boundaries, we monitored populations of five coral species within a marginal habitat and used a year of in situ measures to model thermal performance of vital host, symbiont and holobiont physiology. Metabolic responses to temperature revealed two acclimatization strategies: peak productivity occurring at annual midpoint temperatures (4-6 degrees C lower than tropical counterparts), or at annual maxima. Modelled relationships between temperature and P:R were compared to a year of daily subtropical sea temperatures and revealed that the relatively short time spent at any one temperature, limited optimal performance of all strategies to approximately half the days of the year. Thus, while subtropical corals can adjust their physiology to persist through seasonal lows, seasonal variation seems to be the key factor limiting coral productivity.

Diversification and range expansion relate to lineage-specific niche characters, but this link has seldom been quantified across multiple lineages and environments. This study explored the link between local dominance and soil niche in rain forest plants, and tested the hypothesis that local soil niche patterns can be used to predict the global diversity and occupancy of equal-aged plant lineages. Location The study was carried out in Brunei Darussalam (Borneo) and projected worldwide. Methods Our approach involved the subdivision of vascular plants into the lineages found 120 Mya, a time preceding the explosive radiation of the eudicots. We quantified the representation of the 120 Mya lineages in different forest types associated with dramatically different soils, but sharing the same climatic conditions. The forest types included primary and secondary lowland rain forest, flooded and nutrient-impoverished inland forests, and mangroves. Niche breadth and position, estimated from the soil types that a lineage occupied, were used to predict global diversity and occupancy patterns, after accounting for relatedness to the dominant eudicots. Results Despite marked differences in soil characteristics among the forest types, three eudicot lineages (Malvidae, Fabidae, Asteridae) were consistently dominant over the other 28 lineages present. A broad, intermediate soil niche, relatedness to eudicots, and the interaction between these factors were found to be strong predictors of global diversity and occupancy. Main conclusions We show that vegetation plot data from one of the world's most diverse regions (in terms of plant species richness and ancient lineage representation) can be used to successfully predict lineage diversity and occupancy on a global scale. However, because lineage dominance likely depends on the interaction between soil niche and above-ground factors, including above-ground niche features should improve the accuracy of predicting global distribution and diversity-particularly when explaining eudicot dominance.",,,,"Proches, Serban/A-2044-2008; Sukri, Rahayu/AAJ-9640-2020","Proches, Serban/0000-0002-3415-6930; Sukri, Rahayu/0000-0002-2662-399X; Sieben, Erwin/0000-0002-7813-2586; Marshall, David/0000-0003-3771-5950",,,,,,,,,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,,,OCT,2019,46,10,,,,,2378,2387,,10.1111/jbi.13656,,JUL 2019,,,,,WOS:000477287900001,,,,,,

Despite the critical impact of population growth rates for range expansion, they are neglected in existing empirical studies, which focus on the investigation of selected life-history traits. Here, we present an approach based on non-invasive genetic capture-mark-recapture data for the estimation of adult survival, fecundity and juvenile survival, which determine population growth. We demonstrate the reliability of our method with simulated data, and use it to investigate life-history changes associated with range expansion in 35 colonies of the bat species Rhinolophus hipposideros. Comparing the demographic parameters inferred for 19 of those colonies which belong to an expanding population with those inferred for the remaining 16 colonies from a non-expanding population reveals that range expansion is associated with higher net reproduction. Juvenile survival was the main driver of the observed reproduction increase in this long-lived bat species with low per capita annual reproductive output. The higher average growth rate in the expanding population was not associated with a trade-off between increased reproduction and survival, suggesting that the observed increase in reproduction stems from a higher resource acquisition in the expanding population.

An emerging genomic toolset, which has been most comprehensively harnessed in the reconstruction of human evolutionary history, enables molecular ecologists to elucidate complex population histories. Killer whales have limited extrinsic barriers to dispersal and have radiated globally, and are therefore a good candidate model for the application of such tools. Here, we analyse a global data set of killer whale genomes in a rare attempt to elucidate global population structure in a nonhuman species. We identify a pattern of genetic homogenisation at lower latitudes and the greatest differentiation at high latitudes, even between currently sympatric lineages. The processes underlying the major axis of structure include high drift at the edge of species' range, likely associated with founder effects and allelic surfing during postglacial range expansion. Divergence between Antarctic and non-Antarctic lineages is further driven by ancestry segments with up to fourfold older coalescence time than the genome-wide average; relicts of a previous vicariance during an earlier glacial cycle. Our study further underpins that episodic gene flow is ubiquitous in natural populations, and can occur across great distances and after substantial periods of isolation between populations.

The resulting loss of coral reefs is threatening coastal food and livelihoods. Climate projections suggest that coral reefs will continue to undergo major changes even if the goals of the Paris Agreement (Dec 2015) are successfully implemented. Ecological changes include modified food webs, shifts in community structure, reduced habitat complexity, decreased fecundity and recruitment, changes to fisheries productivity/opportunity, and a shift in the carbonate budget of some ecosystems toward dissolution and erosion of calcium carbonate stocks. Broad estimates of the long-term (present value) of services provided by the ocean's ecological assets exist and are useful in highlighting the value of reefs yet must be contextualised by how people respond under ecosystem change. The dynamic nature of the relationship between people, economies, and the environment complicates estimation of human consequences and economic outcomes of changing environmental and ecological capital. Challenges have increased given lack of baseline data and our inability to predict (with any precision) how people respond to changing coral reef conditions, especially given the variability, flexibility, and creativity shown by human communities and economies under change. Here, we explore how the changes to the three-dimensional structure of coral reefs affect benefits for people, specifically coastal protection, fisheries habitat, and tourism. Based on a review of available data and literature, we make a series of key recommendations that are required to better understanding of how global change will affect people dependent on coral reefs. These include: (1) baseline studies and frameworks for understanding human responses to climate change within complex social and ecological setting such as coral reefs, (2) better tools for exploring environmental benefits, markets, and financial systems faced by change, and (3) the integration of these insights into more effective policy making.

Thus, previous literature has concluded that invasions have a fundamental spatial scale-dependent relationship with diversity. Whether the scale-dependent effects apply to vertebrate invaders is questionable because studies consistently report that vertebrate invasions produce different outcomes than plant or invertebrate invasions. Namely, vertebrate invasions generally have a larger effect size on species richness and vertebrate invaders commonly cause extinction, whereas extinctions are rare following invertebrate or plant invasions. In an agroecosystem invaded by a non-native ungulate (i.e., feral swine, Sus scrofa), we monitored species richness of native vertebrates in forest fragments ranging across four orders of magnitude in area. We tested three predictions of the scale-dependence hypothesis: (a) Vertebrate species richness would positively increase with area, (b) the species richness y-intercept would be lower when invaded, and (c) the rate of native species accumulation with area would be steeper when invaded. Indeed, native vertebrate richness increased with area and the species richness was 26% lower than should be expected when the invasive ungulate was present. However, there was no evidence that the relationship was scale dependent.

We combined microsatellite data (63 populations, 1756 individuals) and ecological niche modeling to examine the range-wide population diversity, genetic structure, and historical demography of a pioneer tree species, Asian white birch (Betula platyphylla Suk.) across East Asia. We found a north-to-south trend of declining genetic diversity and five clusters, corresponding to geographical regions. Different clusters were inferred to have diverged through Pleistocene climatic oscillations and have different expansion routes, leading to genetic admixture in some populations. Ecological niche models indicated that the distribution of B. platyphylla during the last glacial maximum still had a large latitude span with slight shifts toward southeast, and northern populations had more variable distribution ranges than those in the south during later climatic oscillations. Our results reflect the relatively stable distribution through the last glacial-interglacial cycles and recent multidirectional expansion of B. platyphylla, providing new hypotheses for the response pattern of widespread tree species to climate change.

Theoretical models, however, show that range expansion depends on both habitat quality and habitat-specific movement rates. Using data from 78 species in 70 studies, we find that animals typically have faster movement through lower-quality environments (73% of published cases). Therefore, if we want to manage landscapes for range expansion, there is a trade-off between promoting movement with nonhostile matrix, and promoting population growth with high-quality habitat. We illustrate how this trade-off plays out with the use of an exemplar species, the Baltimore checkerspot butterfly. For this species, we calculate that the expected rate of range expansion is fastest in landscapes with similar to 15% high-quality habitat. Behavioral responses to nonhabitat matrix have often been documented in animal populations, but rarely included in empirical predictions of range expansion.

Despite motivating much work on plant-herbivore coevolution and defense theory, Ehrlich and Raven never proposed a mechanism for their escape and radiate model. Recent intriguing mechanisms proposed by Marquis et al. include sympatric divergence, pleiotropic effects of plant defense traits on reproductive isolation, and strong postzygotic isolation, but these may not be general features of herbivore-mediated speciation. An alternate view is that herbivores may impose strong divergent selection on defenses in allopatric plant populations, with plant-herbivore coevolution driving local adaptation resulting in plant speciation. Building on these ideas, we propose three scenarios that consider the role of herbivores in plant speciation. These include (1) vicariance, subsequent coevolution within populations and adaptive divergence between geographically isolated populations, (2) colonization of a new habitat lacking effective herbivores followed by loss of defense and then re-evolution and coevolution of defense in response to novel herbivores, and (3) evolution of a new defense followed by range expansion, vicariance, and coevolution. We discuss the general role of coevolution in plant speciation and consider outstanding issues related to understanding: (1) the mechanisms behind cospeciation of plants and insects, (2) geographic variation in defense phenotypes, (3) how defensive traits and geography map on plant phylogenies, and (4) the role of herbivores in driving character displacement in defense phenotypes of related species in sympatry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,JUL,2019,100,7,,,,,,,e02704,10.1002/ecy.2704,,,,,,,WOS:000474286800018,30916391,,,,,

We used Ageratina adenophora, an invasive plant with restricted evolutionary potential to investigate shifts in the realized climatic niche independent of potential evolutionary adaptations. Location Native Mexican range; exotic ranges in Asia, the USA, the Canary Islands and Australia. Taxon Invasive Asteraceae A. adenophora (Spreng.) R.M.King & H.Rob. Commonly known as Crofton weed. Methods We compiled a robust occurrence dataset of A. adenophora for its native Mexican range and four exotic ranges (Asia, USA, Canary Islands, and Australia) and quantified pairwise niche overlap (Schoener's D) and niche dynamic (stable, unfilling and expansion) indices between the native and exotic ranges in reduced climatic space using smoothed occurrence densities. Niche shift was statistically tested using niche equivalency tests. Results The value of niche overlap (Schoener's D) differed considerably, ranging from relatively high between Mexico and Asia to low between Mexico and Australia. The niche dynamic indices indicated highest level of niche stability in Asia while highest degree of unstable niche was detected in Australia due to both niche expansion and unfilling. The niche similarity tests indicated that the native niche is more similar to the exotic niche than any randomly sampled niche from the exotic range. However, the niche equivalency tests showed evidence of niche differentiation as the observed niche overlap was lower than expected by chance for all pairwise comparisons. Jointly these tests indicate that despite the similarity, the native niche is not perfectly identical to any of the exotic niches. Main conclusions The current study has direct implications for understanding range expansion of invasive species even in the absence of evolutionary adaptation.

Results We found strong positive relationships between the number of species northern range endpoints and the steepness of the latitudinal sea surface temperature gradient on the western margins of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but no relationship on the eastern margins of these ocean basins. The strongest predictors of range extent in our global model are ocean basin/margin and depth range. Maximum body length, schooling behaviour and use of multiple habitats are also significant predictors of range extent in the global model. The factors influencing range extent differ by basin and margin. Main conclusions There are broad differences in patterns of species range extent and distribution of species ranges among basins/margins. These differences appear to be driven in part by variation in latitudinal water temperature gradient between basin margins.

We performed genetic structure analyses and demographic reconstructions based on the site frequency spectrum (SFS). We additionally used the same genotyping protocol to assess the genomic diversity of a set of 32 cultivars representative of the L. perenne cultivars widely used for forage purposes. Results Expansion across Europe took place during the Wurm glaciation (12-110 kya), a cooling period that decreased the dominance of trees in favour of grasses. Splits and admixtures in L. perenne fit historical climate changes in the Mediterranean basin. The development of agriculture in Europe (7-3.5 kya), that caused an increase in the abundance of grasslands, did not have an effect on the demographic patterns of L. perenne.

We investigated their population structure and population history in response to past climatic change using a sample of 619 individuals in 34 populations with nITS and ptDNA sequences. A significant genetic divergence between the two species was supported by a high level of pairwise genetic differentiation, very low gene flow, and phylogenetic analysis showing that I. songaricum haplotypes were monophyletic, whereas those of I. tataricum were polyphyletic. We found significant differentiation and phylogeographic structure in both species. The split of the two species was dated to the late Miocene (similar to 7 Ma), but deep divergence occurred in the mid-late Quaternary. A similar haplotype distribution pattern was found in both species: one to two dominant haplotypes across most populations, with unique haplotypes in a few populations or a geographic group. The genetic diversity, haplotype number, and haplotype diversity decreased from the Yili Valley to the central Tianshan and Barluk Mountains. Additionally, ptDNA analysis showed that I. tataricum diversified in the eastern Tianshan and Barluk Mountains, which might be due to physical barriers to long distance seed dispersal such as desert.

Location We investigated the range of an annual plant, Cakile edentula var. lacustris, which occupies beaches spanning a 555 km latitudinal gradient along the Laurentian Great Lakes. Methods We built a hybrid model that combines climatic niche modelling, based on decadal climate projections, with an individual-based model that allows for evolutionary processes to act upon a heritable dispersal kernel. We evaluated how spatial variation in dispersal distance and dispersal evolution influenced range dynamics, spatial and temporal variation in dispersal, and the distribution of neutral genetic variation. The model was parametrized with data on C. edentula's distribution, life history and dispersal characteristics. Results Geographic variation in dispersal distance, adaptive dispersal evolution and dispersal distance increased the potential for local populations of C. edentula to keep pace with changing climatic conditions through range shifts. Dispersal distances always increased at the expanding and contracting range edges when dispersal was allowed to evolve. Furthermore, scenarios where dispersal distances were initially lower at the range edges resulted in the largest evolutionary changes over 105 years (>1.5 km increase in mean distance at northern edge).

J,"Nadeau, CP; Urban, MC",,,,"Nadeau, Christopher P.; Urban, Mark C.",,,Eco-evolution on the edge during climate change,ECOGRAPHY,,,,,,,,,,,,"We urgently need to predict species responses to climate change to minimize future biodiversity loss and ensure we do not waste limited resources on ineffective conservation strategies. Currently, most predictions of species responses to climate change ignore the potential for evolution. However, evolution can alter species ecological responses, and different aspects of evolution and ecology can interact to produce complex eco-evolutionary dynamics under climate change. Here we review how evolution could alter ecological responses to climate change on species warm and cool range margins, where evolution could be especially important. We discuss different aspects of evolution in isolation, and then synthesize results to consider how multiple evolutionary processes might interact and affect conservation strategies. On species cool range margins, the evolution of dispersal could increase range expansion rates and allow species to adapt to novel conditions in their new range. However, low genetic variation and genetic drift in small range-front populations could also slow or halt range expansions. Together, these eco-evolutionary effects could cause a three-step, stop-and-go expansion pattern for many species. On warm range margins, isolation among populations could maintain high genetic variation that facilitates evolution to novel climates and allows species to persist longer than expected without evolution. This 'evolutionary extinction debt' could then prevent other species from shifting their ranges. However, as climate change increases isolation among populations, increasing dispersal mortality could select for decreased dispersal and cause rapid range contractions. Some of these eco-evolutionary dynamics could explain why many species are not responding to climate change as predicted. We conclude by suggesting that resurveying historical studies that measured trait frequencies, the strength of selection, or heritabilities could be an efficient way to increase our eco-evolutionary knowledge in climate change biology.",,,,"Nadeau, Christopher P./AAN-6201-2020","Nadeau, Christopher P./0000-0002-3568-0793",,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,,,JUL,2019,42,7,,,SI,,1280,1297,,10.1111/ecog.04404,,,,,,,WOS:000473712400003,,,,,,

This is often attributed to changes on their non-breeding grounds and along their migratory routes. The European honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus) is a scarce migrant in southern Africa that is declining globally. This study assessed the distribution and abundance of honey buzzards in southern Africa over the past four decades and compared it to trends in the East African population to examine possible drivers of population expansion in southern Africa. Location Southern and East Africa. Methods European honey buzzard reporting data were collected from a variety of sources including citizen science databases (1983-2017). In addition, records of all other southern African vagrants (including ten other regularly occurring species) were gathered to account for changes in birdwatching effort in the subregion. To assess the effect of forest loss on honey buzzard abundance, rolling correlations were performed using forest cover in East Africa and number of honey buzzard records in both subregions. Results European honey buzzard records in southern Africa have increased over five times more than other regularly occurring vagrant species and almost 40 times more than honey buzzard in Tanzania, where the population has remained stable. Loss of forested area in East Africa was correlated with an increase in European honey buzzard records in southern Africa. Main conclusions We suggest that the European honey buzzard shift in wintering range may be driven by a decline in suitable habitat further north in Africa amongst other possible reasons. This effect may have been amplified by an increase in appropriate habitat across southern Africa brought about by anthropogenic changes to vegetation such as increased tree cover in urban areas.

The prevalence of T. procumbens in central regions of India could demonstrate its greater dependencies on precipitation seasonality and radiation than that on temperature. These discrepancies in climatic dependencies allowed both for a harmonious distribution, i.e., inhabiting in regions not utilised by other. Both are likely to reduce their potential distribution areas in the future climate, where moisture availability is a key factor for their range expansion.

The two species have similar invasion histories but differ in climatic tolerances in their native ranges, therefore we expected them to differ in their potential to spread within New Zealand. We transplanted individuals of both species along an elevation and precipitation gradient and measured plant growth, mortality and seedling establishment over 2years. Both species responded strongly and in similar ways to climatic variation along the gradient. Annual frost days was a strong predictor of performance for both species; plants grown at sites with more frost days had lower growth, survival and reproduction.

Shifts to greater reproductive success and output are expected to occur towards range edges of expanding invasive species as a means of increasing colonization opportunities and accelerating further spread. In a glasshouse experiment, we investigated shifts in reproductive traits (allocation to reproduction, seed number vs. seed size, capacity for self-fertilization) across multiple populations spanning the entire range of two coastal exotic invasive plant species (Gladiolus gueinzii Kunze and Hydrocotyle bonariensis Lam.) in eastern Australia. Although there was no significant increase in allocation to reproduction towards range edges or changes in seed provisioning, range edge populations displayed an increased capacity for self-fertilization in the absence of pollinators for both species. For H. bonariensis this entailed an increase in the probability of fruit production towards range edges while for G. gueinzii it was an increase in the probability of forming developed seeds towards range edges. Greater capacity for self-fertilization may facilitate further range expansion as it alleviates any reliance on external factors for pollination at the range edge.

Reproductive strategies are often cited as a primary driver of invasive success, with human activities further facilitating invasions by, for example, acting as seed vectors for dispersal via road, train, air, and marine traffic, and by producing efficient corridors for movement including canals, drainages, and roadways. Sahara mustard (Brassica tournefortii) is a facultative autogamous annual native to Eurasia that has rapidly invaded the southwestern United States within the past century, displacing natives, and altering water-limited landscapes in the southwest. We used a genotyping-by-sequencing approach to study the population structure and spatial geography of Sahara mustard from 744 individuals from 52 sites across the range of the species' invasion. We also used herbaria records to model range expansion since its initial introduction in the 1920s. We found that Sahara mustard occurs as three populations in the United States unstructured by geography, identified three introduction sites, and combined herbaria records with genomic analyses to map the spread of the species. Low genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium are consistent with self-fertilization, which likely promoted rapid invasive spread. Overall, we found that Sahara mustard experienced atypical expansion patterns, with a relatively constant rate of expansion and without the lag phase that is typical of many invasive species.",,,,"Winkler, Daniel E./C-5710-2019; Francois, Olivier/AAQ-3137-2020; Francois, Olivier/A-6051-2012","Winkler, Daniel E./0000-0003-4825-9073; Francois, Olivier/0000-0003-2402-2442; Francois, Olivier/0000-0003-2402-2442; Chapin, Kenneth/0000-0002-8382-4050",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,JUL,2019,9,14,,,,,7928,7941,,10.1002/ece3.5239,,JUN 2019,,,,,WOS:000478252600001,31380061,,,,,

We analysed how continued warming over the 21st century would affect the distribution of eelgrass Zostera marina, the dominant seagrass in the Northwest Atlantic and provider of essential ecosystem functions and services. We compiled presence-only occurrence records and built a species distribution model using Maxent to determine a present-day distribution, which was compared to physiological thresholds for eelgrass growth and reproduction. Present-day models were then projected to mid- (2040-2050) and end-century (2090-2100) using 2 contrasting emissions scenarios and different global climate models. Our projections suggest an average shift of the southern range limit by 1.41 degrees N to the north under a strong mitigation scenario (RCP 2.6) and 6.48 degrees N under a business-as-usual emissions scenario (RCP 8.5) by 2100, resulting in substantial loss of eelgrass habitat along the eastern coast of the USA. The northern edge shift was less certain, yet resulted in an expansion of total eelgrass habitat. To minimize the extent of eelgrass bed extinction and areas of reduced growth along the southern range, strong climate mitigation is critical. Moreover, warm-temperature stress in reduced-growth areas will greatly increase the susceptibility of eelgrass to other natural or anthropogenic stressors.

Using similar to 30 yr of data from surfclam stock surveys, variance-to-mean ratios (VtMRs) were calculated both temporally and spatially for a range of surfclam size classes to determine the degree of patchiness. The VtMR declined from the 1980s to present in all regions (offshore Delmarva, New Jersey, Long Island, Southern New England, Georges Bank); however, VtMR rose with increasing clam size. Taylor's power law (TPL) analysis corroborated the VtMR; the surfclam is highly patchy across its range. The surfclam's proclivity for a patchy distribution varied regionally. Regions supporting the bulk of the stock were characterized by significantly higher degrees of patchiness and exhibited a higher exponent for the TPL. A species distribution function model corroborated findings of declining patchiness over time, supporting the hypothesis that warming of Mid-Atlantic continental shelf bottom waters is both driving the surfclam into new habitat and extirpating it from nearshore and southern areas. Size-dependent and temporal trends in VtMRs and temporal relative stability in TPL suggest that range expansion is conduced by regional settlement of larvae, followed by biased mortality in suboptimal habitats. This biased mortality ultimately re-establishes the increased patchiness characteristic of larger animals but also predisposes the species to a rapid range shift. Declining VtMRs over time may be a symptom of range expansion along the leading range boundary that has increased the proportion of newly occupied habitat without mature patch characteristics while, at the same time, range recession has removed the older mature patches along the range's trailing edge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,JUN 18,2019,620,,,,,,77,97,,10.3354/meps12964,,,,,,,WOS:000485733300006,,,,,,

Here, we combined stomach content and isotopic analyses to describe the trophic habits of round sardinella in the NW Mediterranean Sea and its trophic relationships with 2 sympatric small pelagic fish, European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and European pilchard Sardina pilchard us. Results revealed changes in the diet of round sardinella during the year. In summer, the most important prey were copepods (Acartia spp.) and cladocerans (Pentlia avirostris). During winter, the diet was composed mainly of copepods and tunicates (mainly appendicularians), but microplankton was also numerically important in adult diets. In contrast to previous studies, during spring, round sardinella principally fed on salps (Thaliacea). To our knowledge, this is the first time that salps have been identified as an important prey for round sardinella. When compared to coexisting small pelagic fish, we found that round sardinella adults had a different trophic niche than anchovy and sardine. In contrast, round sardinella juveniles partially overlapped the trophic niche with the juveniles of the other 2 species. Therefore, the range expansion of round sardinella probably would not affect sardine and anchovy populations.

In some cases geese (partially) gave up migration and started breeding at wintering and stopover grounds. Range expansion may be facilitated and accompanied by physiological changes, especially when associated with changes in migratory behaviour. Interspecific comparisons found that migratory tendency is associated with a higher basal or resting metabolic rate (RMR). We compared RMR of individuals belonging to a migratory and a sedentary colony of barnacle geese Branta leucopsis. The migratory colony is situated in the traditional arctic breeding grounds (Russia), whereas the sedentary colony has recently been established in the now shared wintering area (the Netherlands). We measured RMR by oxygen consumption () during two ontogenetic phases (juvenile growth and adult wing moult). We also investigated juvenile growth rates and adult body mass dynamics. Mass-independent was 13.6% lower in goslings from the sedentary colony than in goslings from the migratory colony. Similarly, in adult geese, mass-independent was 15.5% lower in sedentary than in migratory conspecifics. Goslings in the Netherlands grew 36.2% slower than goslings in Russia, while we found no differences in body dimensions in adults. Adult geese from both colonies commenced wing moult with similar body stores, but whereas Russian barnacle geese maintained this level throughout moult, body stores in geese from the Netherlands fell, being 8.5% lower half-way through the moult. We propose that the colony differences in resting metabolic rate, growth rate and body mass dynamics during moult can be explained by environmental and behavioural differences. The less stringent time constraints combined with poorer foraging opportunities allow for a smaller 'metabolic machinery' in non-migratory geese.

In the summer of 2017 we surveyed 136 sites to determine its current distribution in the state. We found F. enigmaticus at 23 sites ranging from San Francisco Bay in the north to Newport Bay in the south. Populations were concentrated in four regions: San Francisco Bay, Monterey Bay, Santa Barbara, and sites in Los Angeles and Orange Counties. Presence sites did not differ systematically in salinity or temperature from absence sites, but all presence sites appeared to have restricted exchange of water with nearby oceanic habitats. Data on the timing of first discovery in each region is roughly consistent with the hypothesis of southward spread of propagules from the San Francisco Bay population. To further test this hypothesis, we obtained mitochondrial DNA sequences from individuals collected from four sites nearly spanning the current latitudinal range of F. enigmaticus in California. Recent work from Australia suggests that there is substantial within-population cryptic genetic diversity in F. enigmaticus, with individual aggregations containing individuals whose mitochondrial cytochrome B haplotypes fall into one of two very distinct (similar to 19% uncorrected genetic distance) haplotype groups, Clades 1 and 2. We found a similar pattern in California, with Clade 1 and Clade 2 individuals co-occurring at two of the four sites we sampled. Three of ten known F. enigmaticus haplotypes occurring in Australia were observed in California populations; four haplotypes observed in California have not previously been reported.

Disentangling the contribution of environmental gradients from the process of range expansion in shaping these changes, and identifying the specific traits undergoing selection, are both critical to anticipate the secondary spread and impact of invasive species. Here, we investigate phenotypic changes in rusty crayfish (Faxonius rusticus), a nuisance invasive species, through an extensive survey of their invasion gradient in multiple tributaries of the John Day River (JDR, Oregon, U.S.A.), a major tributary of the Columbia River. Rusty crayfish in the JDR have developed better physiological condition (intrinsic growth and/or reproductive potential measured as RNA/DNA ratio) but less competitive morphology (lighter body and smaller claws) as they spread upstream and downstream from their location of initial introduction. In addition, rusty crayfish in invasion front populations are at a lower trophic level than conspecifics closer to core areas. By accounting for variations in temperature, primary productivity, and prey (macroinvertebrates) biomass throughout the invasion extent of rusty crayfish, our findings suggest that low conspecific densities at the invasion edge and spatial sorting primarily drive these phenotypic changes. The trends observed here are thus likely to intensify over time as rusty crayfish continues to rapidly spread throughout the JDR and reach the mainstem Columbia River. Our study shows that phenotypic shifts can manifest rapidly over environmental gradients experienced during the range expansion of aquatic invasive species. Patterns in both morphological and functional traits documented in the JDR demonstrate the importance of both environmental factors and dispersal processes in shaping these responses in riverine networks.",,,,"Olden, Julian D/A-8535-2010","Olden, Julian/0000-0003-2143-1187; Messager, Mathis/0000-0002-3051-8068",,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,,,JUN,2019,64,6,,,,,1196,1209,,10.1111/fwb.13295,,,,,,,WOS:000477644100008,,,,,,
J,"Phillips, B; Perkins, TA",,,,"Phillips, Ben L.; Perkins, T. Alex",,,Spatial sorting as the spatial analogue of natural selection,THEORETICAL ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Considerable research effort has been spent to understand why most organisms disperse despite the clear costs of doing so. One aspect of dispersal evolution that has received recent attention is a process known as spatial sorting, which has been referred to as the shy younger sibling of natural selection. Spatial sorting is the process, whereby variation in dispersal ability is sorted along density clines and will, in nature, often be a transient phenomenon. Despite this transience, spatial sorting is likely a general mechanism behind the evolution of nonzero dispersal rates in spatiotemporally varying environments. While most often transient, spatial sorting is persistent on invasion fronts, where its effect cannot be ignored, causing rapid evolution of traits related to dispersal. Spatial sorting is captured in several elegant models, yet these models require a high level of mathematical sophistication and are not accessible to most evolutionary biologists or their students. Here, we frame spatial sorting in terms of the classic haploid and diploid models of natural selection. We show that, on an invasion front, spatial sorting can be conceptualised precisely as selection operating through space rather than (as with natural selection) time, and that genotypes can be viewed as having both spatial and temporal aspects of fitness. Viewing fitness in this way shows that, on invasion fronts, organisms maximise spatiotemporal fitness, rather than traditional (temporal) fitness. The resultant model is strikingly similar to classic models of natural selection under gene flow. This similarity renders the model easy to understand (and to teach), but also suggests that many established theoretical results around natural selection could apply equally to spatial sorting.",,,,,"Perkins, Alex/0000-0002-7518-4014",,,,,,,,,,,,1874-1738,1874-1746,,,,JUN,2019,12,2,,,SI,,155,163,,10.1007/s12080-019-0412-9,,,,,,,WOS:000476843500004,,,,,,

As the amount of genetic variation is central for long-term persistence of populations, understanding how these processes affect variation over large-scale geographical gradients is pivotal. We investigated the distribution of neutral and putatively adaptive genetic variation, and reconstructed demographic history in the moor frog (Rana arvalis) using 136 individuals from 15 populations along a 1,700-km latitudinal gradient from northern Germany to northern Sweden. Using double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing we obtained 27,590 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and identified differentiation outliers and SNPs associated with growing season length. The populations grouped into a southern and a northern cluster, representing two phylogeographical lineages from different post-glacial colonization routes. Hybrid index estimation and demographic model selection showed strong support for a southern and northern lineage and evidence of gene flow between regions located on each side of a contact zone. However, patterns of past gene flow over the contact zone differed between neutral and putatively adaptive SNPs. While neutral nucleotide diversity was higher along the southern than the northern part of the gradient, nucleotide diversity in differentiation outliers showed the opposite pattern, suggesting differences in the relative strength of selection and drift along the gradient. Variation associated with growing season length decreased with latitude along the southern part of the gradient, but not along the northern part where variation was lower, suggesting stronger climate-mediated selection in the north. Outlier SNPs included loci involved in immunity and developmental processes.",,,,"Richter-Boix, Alex/E-3990-2012","Richter-Boix, Alex/0000-0002-8559-5191; Rodin Morch, Patrik/0000-0001-6737-1488; Laurila, Anssi/0000-0001-8090-3776; Hoglund, Jacob/0000-0002-5840-779X",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-1083,1365-294X,,,,JUN,2019,28,12,,,,,2996,3011,,10.1111/mec.15132,,,,,,,WOS:000475983100005,31134695,,,,,

Yet, maximizing fitness via replication can cause damage to the host and an associated reduction in host movement, incurring a trade-off between transmission and dispersal. Here, we test the idea that pathogens might mitigate this trade-off between reproductive fitness and dispersal by taking advantage of sexual dimorphism in their host, tailoring responses separately to males and females. Using experimental populations of Daphnia magna and its bacterial pathogen Pasteuria ramosa as a test-case, we find evidence that this pathogen can use male hosts as a dispersal vector, and the larger females as high-quality resource patches for optimized production of transmission spores. As sexual dimorphism in dispersal and body size is widespread across the animal kingdom, this differential exploitation of the sexes by a pathogen might be an unappreciated phenomenon, possibly evolved in various systems.",,,,"; Hall, Matthew/A-2006-2009; Phillips, Ben/C-7957-2009","Norgaard, Louise/0000-0002-0938-0017; Hall, Matthew/0000-0002-4738-203X; Phillips, Ben/0000-0003-2580-2336",,,,,,,,,,,,1744-9561,1744-957X,,,,JUN,2019,15,6,,,,,,,20190180,10.1098/rsbl.2019.0180,,,,,,,WOS:000473757900008,31213141,,,,,

Genome-wide differentiation between ants associated with either of the two fungal types is of the same order of magnitude as differentiation associated with temperature and precipitation across the ant's entire range, suggesting that specific ant-fungus genome-genome combinations may have been favoured by selection. For the ant hosts, we found a broad cline of genetic structure across the range, and a reduction of genetic diversity along the axis of range expansion towards the range margin. This population-genetic structure was concordant between the ants and one cultivar type (M-fungi, concordant clines) but discordant for the other cultivar type (T-fungi). Discordance in population-genetic structures between ant hosts and a fungal symbiont is surprising because the ant farmers codisperse with their vertically transmitted fungal symbionts. Discordance implies that (a) the fungi disperse also through between-nest horizontal transfer or other unknown mechanisms, and (b) genetic drift and gene flow can differ in magnitude between each partner and between different ant-fungus combinations. Together, these findings imply that variation in the strength of drift and gene flow experienced by each mutualistic partner affects adaptation to environmental stress at the range margin, and genome-genome interactions between host and symbiont influence adaptive genetic differentiation of the host during range evolution in this obligate mutualism.",,,,"Weber, Jesse N/I-8685-2019; Seal, Jon/M-7396-2018","Weber, Jesse N/0000-0003-4839-6684; Bollazzi, Martin/0000-0003-3361-5602; Roces, Flavio/0000-0001-9258-3079; Kellner, Katrin/0000-0002-8542-6662; Seal, Jon/0000-0001-8013-1438; Mueller, Ulrich/0000-0003-2677-8323",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-1083,1365-294X,,,,JUN,2019,28,11,,,,,2831,2845,,10.1111/mec.15111,,,,,,,WOS:000473204200010,31141257,,,,,
